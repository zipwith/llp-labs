<p>The Portland L4 Kernel, or "pork" for short, is a small, not-quite
complete implementation of L4 for the 32 bit x86 architecture.  You
can download a copy of pork from <a href="pork.tar.gz"><tt>pork.tar.gz</tt></a>
and then unpack it in your <tt>~/Documents/llp/</tt> folder in the usual
way.</p>

<p>After studying parts of the design and implementation of the L4
API and the pork microkernel in the lectures, we use the trace of
output messages provided in the attached <a href="handout.pdf">"handout.pdf"</a>
to walk through the sequence of steps that the machine goes through in
booting and running a simple ping pong demo in pork.  All of the
messages were captured from output sent to the serial port when
the demo was executed.  Key questions to be considering as you
work through the trace include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which parts of the code were responsible for each of
  the output messages that you see?</p></li>

<li><p>What can we tell about the state of the machine at the
  time each of those messages were generated?</p></li>

<li><p>How do the numbers that are included in the output,
  mostly in hexadecimal notation, relate to concepts that might
  be more recognizable to L4 developers (e.g., thread numbers,
  address space details, hardware configuration, etc.)?</p></li>

</ul>
<p>For best results, this demonstration should be given by someone
who can walk through the output log line by line and provide some
explanations about what each message means, and how all of the
indvidual steps contribute to getting a working system up and
running.</p>
