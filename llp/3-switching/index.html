<hr>
</p>
In these exercises, we'll be modifying a version of the
<tt>example-idt</tt> demo, which one of the class demos included is
the code in <a href="prot.tar.gz"><tt>prot.tar.gz</tt></a>.
Once you have a copy of that file in your
<tt>llp</tt> directory (i.e., the one that you share with the virtual
machine, which will be <tt>~/Documents/llp</tt> if you've followed the
defaults suggested in previous labs), then you should be able to unpack
and inspect it using the following commands:
</p><pre>
  tar xvzf prot.tar.gz
  diff -r -C 2 example-idt switching
</pre>
<p>The <tt>diff</tt> command here gives us a concrete way to compare
the code in the <tt>example-idt</tt> and
<tt>switching</tt> folders.  The <tt>-r</tt> command line flag indicates that
we want to compare directories (it is a mnemonic for "recursive",
specifying that <tt>diff</tt> should "recurse" in to subdirectories), while
the <tt>-C 2</tt> flag requests two lines of surrounding "context" for
each change that is displayed, which can make the output a little easier
to understand,
even if it is also a bit longer as a result.  At this point, the only
differences are a change in the menu entry for the GRUB configuration
file and a couple of additional files (which will be introduced later),
as shown in the following output:
</p><pre>
  diff -r -C 2 example-idt/grub.cfg switching/grub.cfg
  *** example-idt/grub.cfg        2017-10-07 10:07:13.000000000 -0700
  --- switching/grub.cfg  2017-10-07 10:07:13.000000000 -0700
  ***************
  *** 2,6 ****
    #set default=0
    
  ! menuentry "protected mode kernel using a simple GDT and IDT" {
      multiboot /mimgload
      module    /image.gz
  --- 2,6 ----
    #set default=0
    
  ! menuentry "context switching demo" {
      multiboot /mimgload
      module    /image.gz
  Only in switching/kernel: hardware.h
  Only in switching/kernel: initpic.s
</pre>
<p>Keep that <tt>diff</tt> command in mind as you proceed with the
exercises described below: it might be useful if things are not
working as you expect at some point and you want to get a detailed
summary of exactly which parts of the code you have modified.  And,
of course, <tt>diff</tt> output might also be <em>very</em> useful
when you're writing up the work you've done for this lab and want
a reminder of all the changes you've made ...</p>

<p>To complete your preparations for the following exercises,
use the following commands to ensure that all of the necessary
libraries and tools are built before you run the initial version
of the code in the <tt>switching</tt> folder:
</p><pre>
  make
  cd switching
  make run
</pre>
<p>
Of course, at this point in the process, other than the change in the
GRUB menu, you should see exactly the same behavior as if you were
running the original <tt>example-idt</tt> example, as demonstrated in
class.  If you're getting a different result, or if you're unable to
compile and/or run the program at all, make sure you ask for help
before proceeding further.</p>

<p>Again, keep the above commands in mind as you proceed; you'll
likely be using <tt>make run</tt> quite heavily as you work through
the steps below, but remember that you need to be in the <tt>switching</tt>
directory for it to work correctly.  And don't forget that you can always
use <tt>make clean</tt> if you ever need to clear out
old versions of compiled code before a recompile, or before making a
tarball or zipfile containing your code.</p>

<p>One last note: Pay particular attention to questions that end with
<b>three question mark symbols</b>: it will be particularly important
that you are able to answer those questions as a way of checking your
understanding, and it would be good to write down your answers as you
proceed through each of the steps.  Where is the first such question
in this document???
</p>

<p>Ok, let's get to work!</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: "hlt is a privileged instruction"</h2>
<p>
In this first step, we'll demonstrate that <tt>hlt</tt> is a
<em>privileged</em> instruction, which means that it cannot be executed
in user mode.  (Or, at least, you can try to execute <tt>hlt</tt> in
protected mode, but it won't actually halt the system!)</p>
<p>
Start by adding a new function called <tt>yield</tt> to the user mode
program (i.e., the code in the <tt>switching/user</tt> folder).
Implement this function in assembly code (in
<tt>userlib.s</tt>), using a simple body that attempts to halt the
machine by using a <tt>hlt</tt> instruction.  You can use the
implementation of <tt>kputc</tt> as a guide for this.  In particular,
don't forget to declare <tt>yield</tt> as a global symbol so that it
will be accessible from your C code.  For safety, you might also
add a <tt>jmp</tt> instruction so that your program will jump back to
retry the <tt>hlt</tt> if, for some reason, the program ever gets to
execute any following code.  You should also add a prototype for this
function (<tt>extern void yield(void);</tt>) at the top of <tt>user.c</tt>,
and insert a call to this function as the last statement in the body
of the <tt>for</tt> loop in <tt>cmain()</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Try the command <tt>make run</tt>; can you explain the results???
</p>
<p>
This might be a good time to introduce the QEMU monitor.  While you
are running a program in QEMU, you can hit Ctrl-Alt-2 to switch
to QEMU's monitor window, or Ctrl-Alt-1 to switch back to the main QEMU
display.  (On a Mac host, you can use the "Option" key instead of "Alt".)
The monitor is useful because it allows you to type in simple
commands to control and inspect the state of the virtual machine.
For example:
<ul>
<li> <tt>"info cpus"</tt> lists current CPU status

<li> <tt>"info registers"</tt> displays the values of all CPU registers
   (Use Ctrl up arrow and Ctrl down arrow to scroll)

<li> <tt>"print $eax"</tt> displays the value of the <tt>eax</tt> register.  More
   generally, you can use <tt>"print expr"</tt>.  (Note that <tt>"print"</tt> can be
   abbreviated as <tt>"p"</tt>.)

<li><tt> "xp /fmt addr"</tt> displays the contents of (physical) memory
   at the specified address (which can be a specific number or a
   register name, such as <tt>$eip</tt>).  The <tt>fmt</tt> parameter determines how
   the data is displayed.  For example, <tt>/5i</tt> will display the next
   five instructions.

<li> <tt>"quit"</tt> aborts the current program and terminates QEMU
</ul>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 2: "Privileged instructions <i>can</i> be executed in Ring 0"</h2>

<p>
We'll start by arranging for the user mode program to ask the kernel
to halt the system, instead of trying to execute the halt instruction
itself.  For this, you should modify your implementation of <tt>yield</tt> to
use <tt>int $129</tt> instead of <tt>hlt</tt>.  (If you prefer to work in
hexadecimal, remember that <tt>$129</tt> is just another way of writing
<tt>$0x81</tt>.)  Don't forget to add a
<tt>ret</tt> instruction after the <tt>int $129</tt> so that your program
will return to the code where <tt>yield()</tt> was called after the
interrupt has been handled.
</p>
<p>
Now we'll need to make sure that the kernel can respond to this
interrupt.  In the <tt>kernel</tt> directory, specifically in
<tt>init.s</tt>,
create an interrupt handler stub
for <tt>yield</tt> that will execute the <tt>hlt</tt> instruction.  In addition,
you'll need to make sure that the IDT will contain an appropriate
entry.  To a large degree, you can model your implementation on what
was done for <tt>"kputc"</tt> ...
</p>
<p>
Now what happens???  How did you confirm that you got the right
result??? (Make sure, in particular that there is no
message indicating that an exception has occurred, and check
what QEMU has to say about <tt>info cpus</tt>.)
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 3: "A (slightly) more interesting system call"</h2>

<p>
Now let's provide a (slightly) more interesting implementation of
yield by making the interrupt handler jump to a label <tt>"yield_imp"</tt>.
Again, you can use <tt>"kputc"</tt> as a model.  We'll write the <tt>yield_imp</tt>
function in C as part of the code for <tt>kernel.c</tt>:
</p><pre>
  void yield_imp() {
      printf("Yielding ...");
      switchToUser(&amp;user);
  }
</pre>
<p>
The first line in this implementation allows us to see that the
kernel is running (the output appears on the left hand side of the
screen).  The second line sends us back in to the user mode program.
(The kernel never actually returns from <tt>yield_imp()</tt>!)
</p>
<p>
What happens if you omit the line <tt>switchToUser(&amp;user);</tt> in
the code above???  How accurately can you predict the result before you
run the program???
</p>
<p>
Verify that this works in the way you would expect ... (and if
you're not sure what to expect, then ask for some help and try to
talk it through ...)
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 4: "Multiple user processes"</h2>

<p>
In the <tt>user</tt> directory, create a new version of the <tt>user</tt>
program called <tt>user2</tt>.  You'll need to make copies of the
<tt>user.c</tt> source file and the <tt>user.ld</tt> script.  I would
suggest modifying the two <tt>.c</tt> files so that you can tell which
one is running by looking at the output messages that they produce.
As for the loader script, we'll want to load both user programs
in memory at the same time, so they can't both start at the same
address.  I suggest configuring <tt>user2</tt> to load at address
<tt>0x500000</tt>, corresponding to 5MB.  Edit the <tt>Makefile</tt>
so that you can build both the <tt>user</tt> and <tt>user2</tt>
executables by using the <tt>make</tt> command.  (It's ok to copy,
paste, and then edit the relevant parts of the rules for building
<tt>user</tt> and <tt>user.o</tt>.)  While we're editing Makefiles,
be sure to add <tt>user/user2</tt> to the <tt>mimgmake</tt> command
in the main <tt>Makefile</tt> (i.e., the <tt>Makefile</tt> in your
<tt>switching</tt> folder).  (Also, in case you're not already aware of
this detail, it might be worth pointing out that all of the command
lines in a <tt>Makefile</tt> must begin with at least one tab
character.)
</p>
<p>
As a review, <tt>mimgload</tt> inserts three entries into the
headers array for each item on the <tt>mimgmake</tt> command
line in the <tt>Makefile</tt>.  For example, the first item in
the command line is the bootdata, and its start, end, and entry
addresses will therefore be listed in entries 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, of the headers array.  Following the same pattern,
the start, end, and entry addresses for the original <tt>user</tt>
program will be in entries 7, 8, and 9, while those for
<tt>user2</tt> will be in entries 10, 11, and 12.  [If you
need more guidance in understanding these numbers, check out
the code at the start of the <tt>kernel()</tt> function that
prints out the header values, and cross reference that with
the output that you see on screen.]
</p>
<p>
We'll also take this opportunity to clean up the display a little.
I suggest modifying the start-up code for the two user programs so
that they set the text windows shown below:
</p>
<p>For <tt>user</tt>:</p>
<pre>
  setWindow( 1, 11, 47, 32);   // user1 process on upper right hand side
</pre>
<p>For <tt>user2</tt>:</p>
<pre>
  setWindow(13, 11, 47, 32);   // user2 process on lower right hand side
</pre>
<p>
In addition, you can modify the code that configures the display at
the start of the main <tt>kernel()</tt> function in <tt>kernel.c</tt>:
</p><pre>
  setAttr(0x2e);               // Create a PSU Green border
  cls();
  setWindow(1, 23, 1, 45);     // kernel on left hand side
  setAttr(7);
  cls();
  printf("Protected kernel has booted!\n");
</pre>
<p>
The following picture shows the corresponding regions on the screen
for each of these three programs.  (But note that <b>the output that
you get right now won't actually look like this in all details until
we get to the end of Step 6</b> and have managed to get both user
programs running.)</p>
<p align=center><a href="annlayout.png"><img src="annlayout.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>How can you verify that your program runs correctly?  [Hints: Look
at the memory map
and header information that is displayed to confirm that both user
programs have been loaded at the expected addresses, and that the
entry points that are displayed make sense.]</p>

<p>You can (and should) experiment with modifying the kernel so that it
will run the second user program instead of the first.  Make sure that
you are using the header information from the <tt>BootData</tt> information
rather than hardwiring a specific address in to your code: those
addresses might change if we do more work on the user programs later
on ...
</p>
<p>
At this point in time, however, the <tt>kernel</tt> code will only be able
to run one of the two user programs.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could
run both?  At the same time?
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 5: "Multiple contexts"</h2>

<p>
Add some new global variables to <tt>kernel.c</tt> so that we can store two
<tt>Context</tt> structures, one for each of the two user programs:
</p><pre>
   struct Context user[2];
   struct Context* current;
</pre>
<p>Replace the code that initialized the original <tt>user</tt>
context with code that will initialize the two separate structures
in the new user array, one for each of our two user mode programs.
Note that you can use the expressions <tt>(user+0)</tt> and
<tt>(user+1)</tt> to get the addresses of the two context structures.
Of course, you can simplify the first of those to just <tt>user</tt>,
if you prefer.</p>

<p>Update the rest of the program so that any remaining references to
<tt>user</tt> are replaced with appropriate uses of <tt>"current"</tt>
instead.  Note that <tt>"current"</tt> is a pointer, so you won't
have to take its address using <tt>&amp;</tt>, but you will need to
use the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator instead of the <tt>.</tt> operator
to access its fields.  What results do you expect to get when you
initialize <tt>current</tt>, either to <tt>(user+0)</tt>, or to
<tt>(user+1)</tt>, and do you see those results in practice???</p>

<p>Using these two <tt>Context</tt> structures, we will be able to
switch back and forth between executing the two user programs.  To make
this work, we'll run one program for a bit, then save its registers
in the associated <tt>Context</tt> structure, load the registers for
the other program from its <tt>Context</tt>, and start executing the
second program.  We can repeat this process indefinitely until both
programs are done.   It should now be clear why we refer to this
technique as "context switching".  But this leaves a question that
we haven't tackled directly so far: Why did we go to the trouble of
making <em>two</em> distinct <tt>user</tt> programs???  For example,
why can't we just use <em>one</em> program but run multiple copies of
it at the same time by having a separate <tt>Context</tt> structure
for each one???</p>

<p>You might be tempted to add context switching at this point, but
<b>make sure you've completed the steps above and that everything is
working correctly before you move on ...</b></p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 6: "Context Switching"</h2>

<p>
Update your <tt>yield_imp()</tt> implementation so that it changes the
value of <tt>current</tt> each time it is called to alternate between the
two user contexts.  Something like the following should do the
trick:
</p><pre>
    current = (current==user) ? (user+1) : user;
</pre>
<p>
Test to see if you get the desired behavior.  [Hint: it will
probably be pretty close, but not exactly perfect ... you may
need to look very carefully to see what is missing.]
Did this version of the program work correctly???  If so, how
did you verify that???  If not, what was wrong???
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 7: "May I interrupt you (on a regular basis)?"</h2>

<p>
Now we're going to use the hardware to force context switching
at regular intervals, even if the user programs don't <tt>yield()</tt>.
To get started, you can prevent <tt>yield</tt> from having any effect at
all by commenting out the line we just put in to change contexts.
Now that's gone, we'll know that any context switching that occurs
will be the result of whatever new code we add.  If you really want
to be sure, you can delete the calls to <tt>yield()</tt> altogether
in both user programs.  (If you keep the calls to <tt>yield()</tt>
in your user programs and don't comment out the context switching
line in the <tt>yield_imp()</tt> function, then you might notice some
significant, negative impacts on performance and functionality; by all
means feel free to come back later on to experiment with this and see
if you can figure out why this is happening ...)
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, however, we are going to need a fair bit of new code to
complete this step:
<ul>
<li><p>The code in the <tt>switching/kernel</tt> subdirectory includes
    an assembly code source file, <tt>initpic.s</tt>, that was not
    part of the original <tt>example-idt</tt> demo program.  You're
    not expected to understand the details of how it works at this
    point, but the code in this file implements a function that could
    be declared in C as:
</p><pre>
     extern void initPIC();
</pre></p>
    that initializes a standard hardware component on the PC called the
    PIC, or <em>Programmable Interrupt Controller</em>.  To make this
    code available, you'll need to modify the <tt>Makefile</tt> so that
    <tt>initpic.s</tt> is compiled (strictly speaking, assembled) and
    linked in with the <tt>kernel</tt> executable.  [Hint: You can follow
    the pattern that is used for <tt>init.s</tt>.]  You should also add
    the above function prototype somewhere near the top of
    <tt>kernel.c</tt>.</p>

<li><p>The <tt>switching/kernel</tt> subdirectory also includes an extra
    header file called <tt>"hardware.h"</tt>.  This file provides
    implementations of some functions for interacting with the PIC, as
    well as some code for configuring a second hardware device, the PIT,
    or <em>Programmable Interval Timer</em> that is also part of standard
    PC systems.  Again, you're welcome to peruse the code, but not
    expected to understand all of the details.  But one thing you will
    need to do is to <tt>#include "hardware.h"</tt> at the top of your
    <tt>kernel.c</tt> source file.</p>

<li><p>Add a new interrupt handler in <tt>init.s</tt> with the following code:
</p><pre>
     timerHandler:
        sub     $4, %esp
        push    %gs
        push    %fs
        push    %es
        push    %ds
        pusha
        leal    stack, %esp
        jmp     timerInterrupt
</pre><p>
  You will also need to add an entry for this handler in the IDT;
  be sure to use slot 32 for this because that is the slot that
  the timer hardware is configured to use.  Note, however, that
  you won't need to specify a <tt>dpl</tt> parameter this time;
  the default value of <tt>0</tt> will work just fine.</p>

<li><p>Next, add an implementation of the <tt>timerInterrupt</tt> function (which
  appeared as the target of the <tt>jmp</tt> instruction in the previous chunk
  of assembly code) in your <tt>kernel.c</tt> file.  Something along the
  following lines should do the trick:
</p><pre>
    static void tick() {
        static unsigned ticks = 0;
        ticks++;
        if ((ticks&15)==0) {
            current = (current==user) ? (user+1) : user;
        }
    }

    void timerInterrupt() {
      maskAckIRQ(TIMERIRQ);
      enableIRQ(TIMERIRQ);
      tick();
      switchToUser(current);
    }
</pre><p>
  I've separated this code in to two sections so that you can focus
  on the code in the <tt>tick()</tt> function and not worry too much about
  the details of interrupt handling in the main <tt>timerInterrupt()</tt>
  function.  We'll learn more about how the latter function works in
  the coming weeks.</p>

<li><p>The final step is to enable interrupts.  (You might want to check
  that all of the code above is compiling and running as expected
  before you do this.)  There are two parts to this.  First, we need
  to make sure that user processes can be interrupted.  We do this
  by making sure that the <tt>IF</tt> bit is set in the <tt>eflags</tt> register for
  each user program.  This can be done at the time we initialize
  the associated contexts: look at the definition of <tt>INIT_USER_FLAGS</tt>
  in <tt>context.h</tt>, and add in the <tt>1 &lt;&lt; IF_SHIFT</tt> component (or just
  use the <tt>#define</tt> for <tt>INIT_USER_FLAGS</tt> that has been commented out)!
</p><p>
  Last, but not least, add the following two lines, in the <tt>kernel()</tt>
  function, right before the point where you start running a user
  mode program for the first time:
</p><pre>
      initPIC();
      startTimer();
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
With all these changes in place, your kernel will configure the PIC
and PIT to interrupt the system 100 times a second, executing the
<tt>tick()</tt> function each time that happens.  And once every 16 calls,
it will automatically context switch between the two user programs,
ensuring that both run to completion!  (We don't need to context
switch as frequently as 100 times a second&mdash;that might create
unnecessary overhead.  And so we choose to switch at 1/16 of that
frequency instead.)
</p>
<p>
How can you tell that the program is working correctly???
For demonstration purposes, you might like to increase the number of
loop iterations in the two user programs (and have the loop bodies print
out the current value of <tt>i</tt> at each step so that you can see it
increasing).  I'd suggest trying 200 iterations in <tt>user.c</tt> and
400 in <tt>user2.c</tt> so that you can see both running together, as
well as what happens when one stops.  (Adjust these numbers up or down,
depending on how fast your VM seems to be running; so long as there is a
noticeable gap between the times that the two user processes finish
doing "useful work", the exact numbers are not important.)
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 8: "Are you sure we're really protected?"</h2>

<p>
Although we are running in "protected" mode, there is, in fact, no real
protection between the code in the different programs.  To illustrate
this, we'll modify <tt>user.c</tt> and <tt>user2.c</tt> to see how one can "interfere"
with the other.
</p>
<p>
First, in <tt>user.c</tt>, add the definition of a variable:
</p><pre>
   volatile unsigned flag = 0;
</pre>
<p>
and then insert the following lines immediately after the main loop:
</p><pre>
  printf("My flag is at 0x%x\n", &flag);
  while (flag==0) {
     /* do nothing */
  }
  printf("Somebody set my flag to %d!\n", flag);
</pre>
<p>
Clearly, <tt>flag</tt> is initialized to zero, and there are no other assignments
to <tt>flag</tt> in the code for <tt>user.c</tt>, so we would not expect the while loop
seen here to terminate.  Try building and running the program to confirm
that the <tt>"Somebody set my flag ..."</tt> message does not appear.
</p>
<p>
Next, pay careful attention to the address that the user program displays
in the <tt>"My flag is at ADDR"</tt> message, and then add the following lines
after the body of the loop in <tt>user2.c</tt>:
</p><pre>
  unsigned* flagAddr = (unsigned*)ADDR;
  printf("flagAddr = 0x%x\n", flagAddr);
  *flagAddr = 1234;
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>ADDR</tt> is replaced with the previously observed flag address.  Make
and run to see what happens now.  Oh dear.  And what is special about
addresses that are part of the <tt>user</tt> program?  In other words, is
there anything that might prevent <tt>user2</tt> from interfering with (or
even rewriting) the <tt>kernel</tt> code???  Oh dear indeed.  We'll have to work
on this some more ... :-)
</p>
<p>
[Of course, this shouldn't really be a surprise: our kernel and user
programs have been happily writing in to the same video RAM ever since
we got started with these exercises; it's only the careful choice of
parameters to <tt>setWindow()</tt> that have prevented them from interfering
with one another before now ...]
</p>
<p>
But to have just a little more fun before we get there ...
</p>

<h2>Step 9: "What time is it?"</h2>

<p>
As a stretch goal, you might like to try adding a "clock" that provides
a continuous display of the current time (i.e., the number of <tt>ticks</tt>
since the kernel started) on the top line of the video RAM.  The
fine details of how you do this are up to you: you don't need to worry
about displaying the actual time of day, counting seconds, or displaying
a traditional clock face.  For example, I thought that showing an eight
digit hexadecimal display would be a good approach, especially
after I had spent some time thinking about how to generate hex output
for numeric values at the end of the earlier video RAM lab ...

<h2>The end</h2>
<p>
That wraps up the context switching lab, but be sure that you
understand how all this code works (and ask for help if you do
not) because we'll definitely be building on this work as our
foundation for studying paging and virtual memory in the next lab!
