<p>
The exercises described on this page build on the code base that
you have developed in <a href="../4-paging/index.html">Paging, Part 1</a>.
The starting point for those previous exercises included skeleton code
including a number of <tt>TODO</tt> items.  But, by the time you were
done, almost all of those annotations should have been erased and
you won't find any new <tt>TODO</tt>s to help you this time round.
In general, I'm assuming that you're getting to be more familiar
with finding your way around the code and that you'll be confident
in modifying and extending it without quite as much direct guidance.
However, the exercises on this page are quite challenging, and will
take some time to work through, so <em>please ask if you need a little
extra help at any stage</em>.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: Review</h2><p>
<p>We'll start with a review of what was covered in the previous
set of exercises.  You should make sure that you have completed
all of those steps, with all of the features summarized below,
before continuing with this set of exercises.  Specifically, as
your starting point, you should have built a modified version
of the initial <tt>paging</tt> code that has the following
features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Boot code that creates an initial page directory, enables paging,
    and relocates to an address in the upper 1GB of the virtual address
    space.</p>
<li><p>A set of macros for finding page boundaries relative to a given
    address (see <a href="../paging/index.html#Step2">Step 2</a> in
    the previous set of exercises for details).</p>
<li><p>Initialization code that scans the memory map provided in the
    boot information from <tt>mimgload</tt> to find an unused region of physical
    memory running from <tt>physStart</tt> to <tt>physEnd</tt>.</p>
<li><p>An <tt>allocPage()</tt> function that allocates a single page
    of memory, together with <tt>allocPdir()</tt> and <tt>allocPtab()</tt>
    functions that can be used to allocate memory for individual page
    directory and page table structures, respectively.</p>
<li><p>A <tt>mapPage()</tt> function that can be used to create a
    mapping from a specified virtual address to a corresponding
    physical address.</p>
<li><p>Some simple test code that allocates and initializes a new
    page directory structure that includes mapping for the kernel
    space in addresses over 3GB and a mapping for a 4KB page, starting
    at address <tt>0xb8000</tt> in the virtual address space, to the same
    address in physical memory.</p>
</ul>
<p>The 4KB page mapping described in the last step will allow
user mode code to access the video RAM.  But, up to this point,
we don't actually have any user space code that is ready to run!
Fixing this will be our first big task in the following exercises.
Once we've done that, however, we might start to worry about
whether it is appropriate to allow all user mode processes to
access video RAM.  For example, this might allow different programs
to interfere with or monitor one another by reading and writing
portions of the video RAM that are supposedly outside their own
"window".  Fixing this will be our second task in what follows.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 2: Finding a user mode program to run</h2><p>
The boot information that is displayed when the <tt>kernel</tt>
program starts running should indicate that one (or perhaps more)
user programs has been loaded in to physical memory when the system
was initialized.  But, up to this point, we have not done anything
to allow that program to be executed.  For this to be possible,
we'll need to add some appropriate mappings to our page directory.</p>

<p>The start and end addresses for the (first) user program should be
available to you in <tt>hdrs[7]</tt> and <tt>hdrs[8]</tt> from the
initial boot information.  Maybe you should try printing out those
addresses just to confirm that you can read them properly ... Don't
forget, however, that those values will produce <em>physical</em> rather
than <em>virtual</em> addresses, and that they will be accessed through a
<tt>BootData</tt> structure whose address (and contents) were also
specified by physical addresses.  Now that we're running with the
kernel at high virtual addresses, potentially without mappings for
low virtual addresses, we should make some adjustments to ensure
that we're reading the bootdata through kernel space addresses.
For example, the main bootdata structure should be accessible at
<tt>fromPhys(struct BootData*, 0x1000)</tt>.  You should make
corresponding changes to ensure that you are reading the headers
and memory map fields using kernel space addresses too ...</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 3: Adding some user mode mappings</h2><p>
Once you've found the region of memory where the user program
is stored, you'll want to add some corresponding entries to
the new page directory to ensure that there are appropriate
mappings for all of the corresponding pages in the user code.
This should be
fairly easy to accomplish using your <tt>mapPage()</tt> function,
and you can use <tt>showPdir()</tt> to check your results.  But
do remember that the start and end addresses of the memory where
the user code is stored might not always correspond to page
boundaries, so again you might need to make some adjustments.
Specifically, if you want to make sure that all of the memory
between some addresses <tt>lo</tt> and <tt>hi</tt> is 
accessible, then you will actually need to map everything
from <tt>pageStart(lo)</tt> to <tt>pageEnd(hi)</tt>.  As a further
hint, remember that you can use a macro call <tt>pageNext(p)</tt>
to find the address of the first page after <tt>p</tt>.</p>

<p>As a crosscheck (remembering that your output may look slightly
different), the output on my system shows that the user program is
loaded at addresses <tt>[400000-4025bf]</tt>, and after I've added
the user space mappings for this, my new page directory looks
something like this:</p>
<pre>
  Page directory at c0406000
    [0-3fffff] =&gt; page table at c0407000 (physical 407000):
      b8: [b8000-b8fff] =&gt; [b8000-b8fff] page
    [400000-7fffff] =&gt; page table at c0408000 (physical 408000):
      0: [400000-400fff] =&gt; [400000-400fff] page
      1: [401000-401fff] =&gt; [401000-401fff] page
      2: [402000-402fff] =&gt; [402000-402fff] page
    300: [c0000000-c03fffff] =&gt; [0-3fffff], superpage
    301: [c0400000-c07fffff] =&gt; [400000-7fffff], superpage
    302: [c0800000-c0bfffff] =&gt; [800000-bfffff], superpage
    303: [c0c00000-c0ffffff] =&gt; [c00000-ffffff], superpage
    304: [c1000000-c13fffff] =&gt; [1000000-13fffff], superpage
    305: [c1400000-c17fffff] =&gt; [1400000-17fffff], superpage
    306: [c1800000-c1bfffff] =&gt; [1800000-1bfffff], superpage
    307: [c1c00000-c1ffffff] =&gt; [1c00000-1ffffff], superpage
</pre>
<p>In this case, we can see that the user code fits in to three
pages, starting at address <tt>0x400000</tt>.  Experiment
with changing the address at which the user program is loaded
[Hint: this is specified in <tt>user/user.ld</tt>] and you should
see corresponding changes in the way that the new page directory
is populated.  For example, what happens if the load address is
<tt>0x400eff</tt> (close to the end of the first page after 4MB)
or <tt>0x402eff</tt> (a couple of pages further on)???</tt>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 4: Running the user program in the new page directory</h2>
<p>You probably have just one lingering <tt>TODO</tt> item near
the bottom of the <tt>kernel</tt> code where some old code from
<tt>example-idt</tt> to initialize and run the user program was
commented out.  Now might be a good time to reinstate that code and
check that it works as you would hope and expect.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it would be good to delay switching to your
new page directory until after all of the appropriate entries have
been added.  Reorder the statements in your code so that it doesn't
make the call to <tt>setPdir()</tt> until immediately before the
<tt>switchToUser()</tt> call.  This likely won't make a difference in
this situation, but it is a good practice in general: loading a new
page directory will flush out old TLB entries and make sure that the
memory management unit reads the most recent entries that you have
installed in the new page directory and any associated page tables.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 5: Preparing to context switch</h2><p>
We're going to want to run multiple user programs at the same
time, and that's going to require similar steps to what you
did in the context switching lab to enable timer
interrupts.  If you don't remember what you did there, then
you can either look at the <a href="../switching">original
instructions</a> or else take a peek at your code from that
lab.  As a quick summary, you'll need to make some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt>: add an include for
<tt>"hardware.h"</tt>; insert a call to <tt>startTimer()</tt>;
and define a suitable <tt>timerInterrupt()</tt> function.</p></li>

<li><p>in <tt>kernel/init.S</tt>: add an entry to the IDT for
the timer interrupt (hardware interrupt 0, so it goes in at
slot 32), calling a new system call handler (I'd suggest that
you call the handler something like <tt>timerHandler</tt>);
then add the assembly code for your new handler (you can model
that on the code for another system call) that ends by branching
to the <tt>timerInterrupt()</tt> function that you defined in
<tt>kernel/init.S</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are quite a few fiddly details to get right here, so
proceed carefully, and be prepared to edit the revised code if
it doesn't compile first time.  If you didn't get as far as
adding a clock display in the context switching demo,
then you might at least want to arrange for the timer interrupt
handler to print an occasional <tt>"."</tt> on the screen so that
you can be sure that the timer is running.  But make sure you
don't actually try to context switch just yet: we'll need to
have more than one context first!
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 6: A simple process abstraction</h2><p>
In our original work with context switching, it was enough just
to package up the registers associated with each different user
program in a <tt>struct Context</tt> data structure.  But to
prevent interference between different user space programs, we're
going to run each one in a different address space: in other
words, we're going to need a different page directory for each
user program that we run.  With this in mind, it makes sense
to define a new data structure to store all of the information
that we need for each user program:</p>
<pre>
    struct Process {
        struct Context ctxt;
        struct Pdir*   pdir;
    };
</pre>
<p>(You might think that we could just add the <tt>pdir</tt> field
to our <tt>Context</tt> structure.  That would work right now, but
having a separate <tt>Process</tt> structure will probably work out
better later on when we start adding more fields for each process.)</p>

<p>As a relatively simple step, you should update your code to
work with a <tt>struct Process</tt> object called <tt>proc</tt>,
containing both a context and a page directory, instead of the
original <tt>user</tt> object (which was a <tt>struct Context</tt>).
In particular, this will mean changing every reference to
<tt>user</tt> in the previous version of your code to a reference
to <tt>proc.ctxt</tt>.  It would also be a good idea to initialize
the <tt>pdir</tt> field of <tt>proc</tt> to the <tt>newpdir</tt>
that you've worked hard to create, and then use <tt>proc.pdir</tt>
when you activate the new page directory.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 7: Creating multiple processes</h2><p>
In this step, we're going to create two separate processes, each of
which can run its own copy of the user-level program.  Unfortunately,
the <tt>BootData</tt> headers tell us where the code and data for
the user program begins and ends, but they don't provide any more
details about which parts of that memory correspond to <tt>.text</tt>
sections (i.e., program code that could potentially be shared between
multiple instances of a user program) and <tt>.data</tt> sections
(which would require a separate copy for each program).  For this
reason, we'll need to create two completely separate copies of the
user program so that each one can have its own <tt>.data</tt>.</p>

<p>I suggest that you approach this in multiple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, write a <tt>copyRegion()</tt> function that will
    make a fresh copy of the pages containing the memory between two
    given physical addresses, <tt>lo</tt> and <tt>hi</tt>.
    The basic definition for this function might look something
    like the following:
</p>
<pre>
    unsigned copyRegion(unsigned lo, unsigned hi) {
        // Check that lo&lt;hi, and take appropriate steps to
        // ensure that lo and hi correspond to suitable page
        // boundaries.

        // Figure out if there is enough memory left in the
        // pool between physStart and physEnd to make a copy
        // of the data between lo and hi.

        // Make a copy of the data.  You'll need to convert
        // between physical and virtual addresses in some way
        // here, but it would be nice to avoid having to do
        // that on every loop iteration ...

        // Update physStart as necessary.

        // Return the physical address of the start of the
        // region where the new copy was placed.
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Your implementation of <tt>copyRegion()</tt> will have some
    strong similarities to the code that you wrote for
    <tt>allocPage()</tt> except that <tt>copyRegion()</tt> will
    often need to allocate more than one page of physical memory
    at a time.  By all means add some <tt>printf()</tt> calls
    in your code so that you'll be able to check that your
    <tt>copyRegion()</tt> function works correctly when it is
    executed.</p>

<li><p>Next, you can write a function that will allocate a new page
    directory that includes appropriate mappings for the user
    program.  Something like the following would likely be a good
    place to start:
    </p>
<pre>
    struct Pdir* newUserPdir(unsigned lo, unsigned hi) {
      struct Pdir* pdir = allocPdir();
      unsigned phys = copyRegion(lo, hi);

      // Add a mapping for video RAM

      // Add mappings to ensure that the region between lo and
      // hi in the new address space is mapped to the appropriate
      // portions of the pages starting at address phys.

      return pdir;
    }
</pre>
<p>You should be able to adapt some of the code that you wrote previously
in Step 3 for this; the difference now is that you'll be using different
virtual and physical addresses for the extra mappings: you'll be mapping
the region from <tt>lo</tt> to <tt>hi</tt> to pages starting at the
physical address that is returned by your <tt>copyRegion()</tt> function.</p>

<li><p>Now you can write a function that will initialize a given
<tt>struct Process</tt> using appropriate <tt>lo</tt> and
<tt>hi</tt> values to initialize the page directory, and a
suitable <tt>entry</tt> point address to initialize the context.
Try the following skeleton as a starting point:
</p>
<pre>
    void initProcess(struct Process* proc,
                     unsigned lo,
                     unsigned hi,
                     unsigned entry) {
        // TODO: fill this in ...
    }
</pre>
</ul>
<p>After all this, you you should be able to initialize two
distinct <tt>struct Process</tt> objects and use either one to
start a user program.  A good way to approach this would be
to define an array of two <tt>Process</tt> structures, as
well as a pointer to the <tt>current</tt> process that looks
something like this:</p>
<pre>
  struct Process  proc[2];
  struct Process* current;
</pre>
<p>Be sure to initialize <tt>current</tt> to <tt>proc+0</tt>
or <tt>proc+1</tt>, and then modify the rest of your code to
use <tt>current</tt> rather than <tt>proc</tt>.  Note that,
in places where you previously wrote something like <tt>proc.blah</tt>,
you will now need to write <tt>current-&gt;blah</tt>, reflecting
the fact that <tt>current</tt> is a pointer to a <tt>struct</tt>
rather than the name of a specific <tt>struct</tt>.</p>

<p>(It might be difficult to tell exactly which of the two programs
is running from the output on screen, but you'll know by looking at
the code ... or perhaps by inserting some extra <tt>printf()</tt>
calls ...</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 8: Context switching, at last</h2><p>
Now you have multiple <tt>Process</tt> objects and a timer interrupt
signal, you should be able to get the two user programs running
together at the same time, context switching from one to the other
on a regular basis.  Don't forget that switching between processes
doesn't just require a change of context any more ... it also requires
a change of page directory: you should use a call that looks something
like the following to accomplish this:</p>
<pre>
   setPdir(toPhys(current-&gt;pdir));
</pre>
<p>Bad things will happen if you forget to translate the virtual
address in <tt>current-&gt;pdir</tt> in to a physical address that
is suitable for loading in to the <tt>CR3</tt> register.  Just to
reinforce that point, see what happens when you leave out the
<tt>toPhys()</tt> call.  Wouldn't it be nice if the compiler printed
an error message and prevented us from running the program when we
make an error like this?</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 9: Protecting access to video RAM</h2><p>
At this point, you should have two user processes running, but it
might be hard to tell because both of them are writing to the same
region of video RAM.  This highlights the fact that our two programs
are not quite as <em>protected</em> from one another as we might hope.
Although neither process has access to the main code or data sections
of the other, they can both read and write the same locations in
video RAM.</p>

<p>We could avoid the problem of having both user programs using the
same window on screen by arranging for some additional information to
be passed to the user programs when they are first run.  (For example,
we could provide some parameters to each process, such as the
coordinates for its video window, by writing appropriate values in
its initial <tt>Context</tt>.)  This, however, would not do anything
to prevent the two processes from communicating or interfering with
one another via the video RAM.</p>

<p>One way to ensure protection is to move the functionality for
writing to video RAM inside the kernel, and to provide system calls
that user programs can invoke to produce output on the screen.
It will take a couple of steps to make this work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we'll need a copy of the <tt>winio</tt> library, which
    is a version of
    the original <tt>simpleio</tt> library that supports multiple
    output windows within a single program.  The key idea is to
    package up all of the details about a single output
    window&mdash;including the position, size, attribute, and
    current coordinates&mdash;in a new <tt>struct Window</tt>
    object.  You can download a copy of a suitable library from
    <a href="../winio.tar.gz">this link</a>.  Unpack this file
    in your main <tt>llp</tt> folder; run <tt>make</tt>
    inside the <tt>winio</tt> directory; and peruse the
    <tt>winio.h</tt> header file for details of the functions
    that it provides. (It's not very long!)</p>

    <p>In addition, <tt>winio</tt> also provides a new
    version of <tt>printf</tt> that is able to print unsigned
    integers in a (sometimes) more readable form as a short
    decimal number followed by a suffix of either <tt>G</tt>,
    <tt>M</tt>, or <tt>K</tt> if the number is a multiple
    of 2<sup>30</sup>, 2<sup>20</sup>, or 2<sup>10</sup>,
    respectively.  For example, using this format, <tt>4096</tt>
    will be displayed as <tt>4K</tt> while <tt>0xc0000000</tt>
    will be displayed as <tt>3G</tt>.  To use this new format,
    insert a <tt>z</tt> character (chosen as a mnemonic for
    "siZe") between the <tt>%</tt> and the numeric radix specified
    (typically a <tt>d</tt> for decimal output).  For example,
    the call <tt>printf("%zd\n", 3*(1&lt;&lt;16));</tt> will
    display <tt>192K</tt>, which is probably a bit easier to
    read and understand than <tt>196608</tt>, its full decimal
    equivalent.</p></li>

<li><p>Next, we'll need to modify the kernel to use <tt>winio</tt>
    instead of <tt>simpleio</tt>.  This will require changes to the
    <tt>Makefile</tt> (replace references to the <tt>simpleio</tt>
    folder with references to the <tt>winio</tt> folder, and change
    library specification from <tt>-lio</tt> to <tt>-lwinio</tt>.
    You will also need to change the include lines at the top of
    <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt> and <tt>kernel/paging.c</tt> to
    use <tt>"winio.h"</tt> rather than <tt>"simpleio.h"</tt>.
    Finally, you'll need to edit the code for <tt>nohandler</tt>
    in <tt>kernel/init.S</tt>.  Previously, this code used a call
    to a function called <tt>printf()</tt>, but with <tt>winio</tt>,
    <tt>printf()</tt> is implemented using a macro that calls the
    function <tt>wprintf()</tt> with an extra argument called
    <tt>console</tt>.  In other words, you'll need to replace the
    line:</p>
<pre>
    call    printf
</pre>
    with the two lines:
<pre>
    pushl   $console      # add the extra argument
    call    wprintf       # call the new function
</pre>
    <p>After these changes, your code should compile and run as before.</p></li>

<li><p>Now we'll need to allow for different user programs to have
    different windows on the screen.  You can handle this by
    adding a <tt>struct Window</tt> field called <tt>win</tt> to the
    definition of <tt>struct Process</tt> and initializing the window
    parameters in an appropriate way when the rest of the fields in
    each <tt>struct Process</tt> are initialized.  For consistency
    with past examples, I would suggest using:</p>
<pre>
  wsetWindow(&proc[0].win, 1, 11, 47, 32); // process 0 upper right
  wsetAttr(&proc[0].win, 1);               // blue output

  wsetWindow(&proc[1].win, 13, 11, 47, 32);// process 1 lower right
  wsetAttr(&proc[1].win, 4);               // red output
</pre>
    <p>Output from the kernel should still use <tt>printf()</tt> and
    related functions, but output that is produced on behalf of user
    programs (e.g., in a system call) should use <tt>wprintf()</tt>
    with the address of the <tt>Window</tt> structure in the
    corresponding <tt>Process</tt> object.  (In fact, <tt>printf()</tt>
    is implemented by a C macro that expands to a <tt>wprintf()</tt>
    call with the previously mentioned<tt>console</tt> as an extra
    argument.</p></li>

<li><p>Now you should make sure that your kernel provides three system
    calls: one for outputing a single character within the user program's
    window; one for clearing the user program's portion of the screen; and
    one for setting the appropriate video attribute.  I suggest that you use
    interrupts 129, 130, and 131 for these respectively, keeping the existing
    entry 128 for <tt>kputc</tt> in place.  In each case, this
    will require: an entry in the IDT; an assembly language handler to save
    the context; and the main implementation.  Following the pattern we have
    seen previously, the first two of those items can be handled by code in
    <tt>kernel/init.S</tt>, while the last can be handled by adding code in
    <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt>.</li>

<li><p>Now that you have provided system calls, you can delete the code
    that includes a mapping for the video RAM in every page directory
    structure you create.  This will force user programs to use the
    kernel system calls for video output and prevent them from interfering
    with one another.  At the same time, removing that mapping from each
    page directory will also prevent the kernel from accessing the video
    RAM at address <tt>0xb8000</tt>.  Fortunately, the kernel can still
    access this region of memory through the high address mapping to
    physical memory (i.e., at address <tt>0xc00b8000</tt>, which is
    just <tt>KERNEL_SPACE+0xb8000</tt>.  However, we do need to add one
    extra line at the start of the <tt>kernel</tt> main code to configure
    the <tt>winio</tt> library to work at this address:</p>
<pre>
   setVideo(KERNEL_SPACE+0xb8000);
</pre></li>

<li><p>Finally, you'll need to change the library that user programs use
    for video output: the old <tt>simpleio</tt> library won't work now
    that we've taken away the mapping for video RAM.  To simplify this
    step, I've packaged up another variant of <tt>simpleio</tt> called
    <tt>userio</tt> that you can <a href="userio.tar.gz">download</a>,
    unpack (in your main <tt>llp</tt> directory, as usual), and run
    <tt>make</tt> in the new <tt>userio</tt> folder.
    Once again, you should peruse the code to get a brief idea about how
    it works and then make the appropriate changes to the code in the
    <tt>user</tt> directory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although there is nothing very deep or new in the above steps,
there is quite a lot of work to do, and hence quite a lot of
potential for making mistakes.  It might take a little while to
get this working properly, but keep going, ask for help if
necessary, and you'll get it up and running properly in the end!
</p>

<p>When everything is finally working as you'd expect, try
experimenting with the code in <tt>user/user.c</tt>; for
example, you might want to add more loop iterations, and
perhaps insert a (nested) loop inside the main loop just
so you can slow things down enough to see the 
effect of having two processes run at the same time.  And
you can also experiment with the <tt>setAttr()</tt> function
from the <tt>userio</tt> library to change the color of the
output text.  One final tweak: perhaps you should arrange
for output that appears in the kernel window but originates
from a user mode program (via the <tt>kputc</tt> system call)
to be displayed in a different color so that there is no
confusion about which parts of the output in the kernel
window are not part of the kernel's own output.</p>

<h2>Step 10: Pause for reflection</h2>
<p>Congratulations: this was a long and arduous journey ... but
you made it!</p>

<p>It's appropriate to pause at this point and enjoy the satisfaction
of reflection on what you have accomplished: Specifically, you now
have a very simple operating system that allows you to run two distinct
copies of the same user level program.  The two programs are protected
from one another because neither one has access to the memory (either
code or data) that the other is using.</p>

<p>As you continue to reflect on this, however, you might start to
wonder whether it's a good idea to include all of the functionality
for video RAM output as part of a kernel ... continuing in this way
will ultimately lead us to a so-called <em>monolithic kernel</em>
that has an unnecessarily large trusted computing base (TCB) because
it includes a lot of code that doesn't strictly need to be executed
in kernel mode.  We don't have a mechanism for IPC (Inter Process
Communication) between processes here, but perhaps you'll start to
ponder how such a feature might be used to move the functionality
for output on screen to a new, user-level process that has exclusive
access to the video RAM at physical address <tt>0xb8000</tt> thanks
to a special kernel mapping ... but all this sounds like an exercise
for another time, don't you think?</p>
