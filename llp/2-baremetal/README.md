# Exercises:

* Add a function to the code for “hello” that can be used to
  output an integer value (hexadecimal notation is probably
  easiest, and most useful too).  Test to make sure it works
  correctly.

* Integrate your assembly code for cls into “hello”.

* Adapt the code from “hello” or “bootinfo” to print out a
  summary of the details that GRUB passes on to the “kernel”
  via the multiboot information structure.  (Start simple,
  and add more fields as you go.)

* Experiment with different virtual machine settings to see
  what impact this has on the information in the multiboot
  structure.
