<p>
The code for this set of exercises is a modified version of the
<tt>example-idt</tt> codebase that you worked on in the context
switching lab; the modifications in this file include some changes
to initialize the paging mechanisms (as described in the Week
4 lecture) and the addition of some <tt>TODO</tt> items to guide you
through these exercises.  You can download a copy of this code from
<a href="paging.tar.gz"><tt>paging.tar.gz</tt></a>, and should unpack
it (using <tt>tar xvzf paging.tar.gz</tt>) in your main <tt>llp</tt>
folder (i.e, the one with subdirectories for <tt>simpleio</tt>,
<tt>mimg</tt>, <tt>example-idt</tt>, <tt>switching</tt>, etc.).
This will create a new <tt>paging</tt> folder where you'll do your
work in this lab, with subfolders for <tt>kernel</tt> and <tt>user</tt>
code, following the pattern you've seen previously.</p>

<p>Because there are some fairly complicated steps in this work,
we'll be splitting these exercises over two weeks:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Week 1: Implement basic support for paging, including functions to
support allocation and initialization of paging structures (page
directories and page tables).</p></li>
<li><p>
Week 2: Implement context switching between multiple user programs,
each running in a distinct virtual address space.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
All of the work for this first week will be done on the files in
the <tt>kernel</tt> subdirectory, but you may wish to keep one
window open in the main <tt>paging</tt> directory (so that you can
<tt>"make run"</tt> for the purposes of testing), and another in
<tt>paging/kernel</tt> so that you are in the most convenient place
to edit the files.
</p><p>
The provided code should compile and run as supplied, but it is
incomplete and has multiple sections with <tt>TODO</tt> comments
describing code that you will need to write.  This document is designed
to be read in conjunction with those source files and annotations.
You are strongly suggested to follow the specific sequence of steps
described below to complete these tasks (augmented with your own
tests along the way, as you see fit), but you may choose to proceed
in a different way if you prefer.  
</p>
<p>
As you work on these exercises, you'll probably want to remind
yourself about the bit layout patterns for page directory and
page table entries.  Here is a snapshot of the table in the
Intel documentation that might be useful for that purpose (clickable
for a full size version):</p>
<p align=center><a href="pdepte.png"><img src="pdepte.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>[Aside: This diagram includes some details for an optional feature
of current Intel architectures called PSE-36 that allows programmers to
specify physical addresses with up to 40 bit addresses for 4MB super pages.
This feature uses bits 12-20 in the second row of the diagram above.  We
are not using that feature here, however, so we will always set those bits
to zero.]
</p>
<p>Ok, let's get started!</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: Review</h2><p>
Review the supplied code, particularly the assembly language sequence
at the start of <tt>kernel/init.S</tt> that enables the IA32's paging mechanism.
Much of this should look familiar from the code that we have discussed
in the Week 4 lecture.  The code that creates the initial page directory
is particularly relevant (i.e., worth your time and careful study)
because you'll be doing something very similar in C later on ...
</p><p>
[Aside: You might be wondering if there is any significance to the
fact that the file name <tt>kernel/init.S</tt> ends with a capital
<tt>S</tt>, unlike the assembly files that we've seen previously with
a lower case <tt>s</tt> suffix.  This is a way of specifying that the
assembly code in that file should be run through the C preprocessor
before it is fed to the assembler.  In particular, this allows use
to use directives like <tt>#include "memory.h"</tt> or <tt>#define
PAGESIZE 12</tt> in our assembly code file, so that we can use the
same symbolic constants as in the accompanying C code.]
</p><p>
Run the program.  How can you tell that paging has been enabled???
(Hint: the clue you're looking for is just one character ...)
</p>
<p>
You'll notice that the program also displays a textual description
of the initial page directory that is used by the code in
<tt>kernel/init.S</tt> when the memory management/paging support is
first turned on.  The output looks like this:
<pre>
  initial page directory is at 0xc0102000
    Page directory at c0102000
      0: [0-3fffff] =&gt; [0-3fffff], superpage
      1: [400000-7fffff] =&gt; [400000-7fffff], superpage
      2: [800000-bfffff] =&gt; [800000-bfffff], superpage
      3: [c00000-ffffff] =&gt; [c00000-ffffff], superpage
      4: [1000000-13fffff] =&gt; [1000000-13fffff], superpage
      5: [1400000-17fffff] =&gt; [1400000-17fffff], superpage
      6: [1800000-1bfffff] =&gt; [1800000-1bfffff], superpage
      7: [1c00000-1ffffff] =&gt; [1c00000-1ffffff], superpage
      300: [c0000000-c03fffff] =&gt; [0-3fffff], superpage
      301: [c0400000-c07fffff] =&gt; [400000-7fffff], superpage
      302: [c0800000-c0bfffff] =&gt; [800000-bfffff], superpage
      303: [c0c00000-c0ffffff] =&gt; [c00000-ffffff], superpage
      304: [c1000000-c13fffff] =&gt; [1000000-13fffff], superpage
      305: [c1400000-c17fffff] =&gt; [1400000-17fffff], superpage
      306: [c1800000-c1bfffff] =&gt; [1800000-1bfffff], superpage
      307: [c1c00000-c1ffffff] =&gt; [1c00000-1ffffff], superpage
</pre>
This output (produced by the <tt>showPdir()</tt> function that is
defined in <tt>kernel/paging.c</tt>) shows that the initial page
directory includes mappings for a total of sixteen superpages:
This includes:
</p>
<ul><li><p>The first 8 slots of the page directory (covering
addresses <tt>0-0x1f_ffff</tt>, which corresponds to 32MB of
physical memory, or 8 superpages, each 4MB in size).</p></li>
<li><p>Another eight entries, starting at position
<tt>0x300</tt> in the page directory, that maps
the same 32MB range of physical memory addresses (shown by the
ranges on the right of the <tt>=&gt;</tt> symbol) in to memory
with the virtual addresses starting at <tt>0xc000_0000</tt>.
Note that this is is just the <tt>KERNEL_SPACE</tt> start address that was
describe in the Lecture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you should recognize the
above as a textual description of the initial page directory
described in the lecture that maps the same region of physical
memory in to virtual memory at two different addresses: a 1:1
mapping allows us to access these memory locations using low
virtual addresses that correspond exactly to the underlying
physical addresses, while the second group of mappings provide
access to the same memory using addresses in the kernel space
region.  Take time to make sure you understand what the text
above is describing: we're going to be creating and manipulating
new page directory structures as we proceed, so it's important
to have a clear idea of what they describe.
</p>
<p>
Ok, it's time to move on.  But a quick heads up before we go further:
you're going to be doing quite a lot of work to get
this code up and running properly.  It won't be easy, and you'll deserve
some credit.  So open up <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt> in your text editor
and add your name at the top of the file!  This will almost certainly
be this easiest of all the changes that you make to the code during
this lab, but it's always nice to start with something simple :-)
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2><a name="Step2">Step 2: Bit twiddling</a></h2><p>
It is fairly common for low-level code to use "bit twiddling", which
involves maninpulating the bit-level representations of values using
appropriate combinations of logical <tt>&amp;</tt> (and), <tt>|</tt>
(or), <tt>^</tt> (xor) and <tt>~</tt> (not) operations as well as
bit shift operations like <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> (left shift) and
<tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> (right shift).  For example: we can extract the
least significant 4 bits of a value <tt>x</tt> using <tt>x &amp; 0xf</tt>;
we can set bit 7 in <tt>x</tt> to one using <tt>x | (1&lt;&lt;7)</tt>;
or reset it using <tt>x &amp; ~(1&lt;&lt;7)</tt>.  Pay careful attention
to operator precedence in examples like this, and don't be shy about
using parentheses where it is either necessary or just useful to clarify
what is expected.  For example, if you want to test whether bit 3 in a
value <tt>x</tt>, you can use <tt>(x&amp;0x8)!=0</tt>, but you should
not omit the parentheses here because <tt>x&amp;0x8!=0</tt> is treated
in the same way as <tt>x&amp;(0x8!=0)</tt>, which does not give the
intended result!
</p>
<p>For some practice in bit twiddling, your next task is to implement
the macros that
are defined/commented out at the end of <tt>memory.h</tt>.  The descriptions
for each macro/function given there should provide all the detail
that you need, and none of them require anything very complicated.
(Although a clear head will be useful!)  Test your implementations
to make sure they work as you expect because you'll be relying on
them soon.  (Hint: you can always <tt>#include "memory.h"</tt> in a regular
C program that you can run directly from Linux to help with your
tests; you might even find a suitable program lurking in the <tt>kernel</tt>
folder ...)
</p>
<p>
The following diagram may help to provide some graphical intuition for
these bit-twiddling macros:</p>
<p align=center><a href="pageboundaries.png"><img src="pageboundaries.png" width=800></a></p>
<p>Specifically, the green region shown here represents a block of
memory running from the address <tt>lo</tt> to the address <tt>hi</tt>,
inclusive.  The vertical ticks indicate page boundaries, spaced at
4K intervals.</p>
<p>It will be important in the following that you understand
what the numbers produced by these macros represent; they will
be needed in later parts of this exercise!  With that in mind,
note that the smallest set of (full) pages that includes all of
the memory in the green region runs from <tt>pageStart(lo)</tt>
to <tt>pageEnd(hi)</tt>.  Conversely, the largest set of full pages
that is completely contained within the green region runs from
<tt>firstPageAfter(lo)</tt> to <tt>endPageBefore(hi)</tt>.  In this
particular example, <tt>firstPageAfter(lo)</tt> is also the same as
<tt>pageNext(lo)</tt> and <tt>pageNext(pageStart(lo))</tt>.  Note,
however, that <tt>pageStart(a)</tt> and <tt>firstPageAfter(a)</tt>
are not always a whole page apart: if <tt>a</tt> is a multiple of 4K,
then <tt>pageStart(a) = a = firstPageAfter(a)</tt>.  In case it is
useful, here are some specific examples to make all this more
concrete:
<pre>
  pageStart(0x12345678)      = 0x12345000
  firstPageAfter(0x12345678) = 0x12346000
  endPageBefore(0x12345678)  = 0x12344fff
  pageEnd(0x12345678)        = 0x12345fff

  pageStart(0xabcde000)      = 0xabcde000
  firstPageAfter(0xabcde000) = 0xabcde000
  endPageBefore(0xabcde000)  = 0xabcddfff
  pageEnd(0xabcde000)        = 0xabcdefff
</pre>
</p>
<p>Another way to think of these examples here is that every
32 bit address, such as <tt>0x12345678</tt>  can be thought of
as a combination of a 20 bit page number, such as <tt>0x12345</tt>
and a 12 bit offset, such as <tt>0x678</tt>.  For example, if we
want to find the start of a page from an arbitrary address, then
we just need to replace the least significant 12 bits with zeros.
Conversely, if we want to find the address of the last byte in a
a page, then we need to replace the least significant 12 bits
with ones, corresponding to <tt>0xfff</tt> in hex notation.</p>

<p>Test your code for these macros carefully, and keep them in
mind as you proceed with subsequent exercises in this lab and
the next ... you can expect to find practical uses for all of
these macros in what is still to come!</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 3: Scanning the memory map</h2><p>
We're going to need to allocate some memory for page directory and
page table structures.  Study the code that prints out a summary
of the memory map at the start of the <tt>kernel()</tt> function in
<tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt> and then start on the first few <tt>TODO</tt>
items in the body of that function.  The algorithm described in those
<tt>TODO</tt>s is not very sophisticated, but it will be sufficient
for our purposes.</p> <p>To be specific, the high level goal here is
to identify a block of pages that the kernel can then use as a pool
to allocate new page table or page directory structures (or other
blocks of memory, in units of 4KB that start on a 4KB boundary).
Be careful to note that a memory map entry spanning from <tt>lo</tt>
to <tt>hi</tt> must be trimmed to the potentially smaller region
between <tt>firstPageAfter(lo)</tt> and <tt>endPageBefore(hi)</tt>
before it can be used for allocating whole pages of memory.  (See the
diagram in Step 2.)</p>

<p><b>Debugging and development hints:</b></p>
<p>Note that, for the purposes of testing, you
can add a call to the <tt>halt()</tt> function at any point
in your code; this will prevent execution from continuing to
parts of the program that you are not ready to run just yet.
(And if your program is "blowing up" for some unknown reason,
you can experiment with adding calls to <tt>halt()</tt> to
figure out how far it is getting before things go wrong!)
Note also that you can insert <tt>printf()</tt> calls in your
code to print out the values that it is working with; this
can often be useful as a way to monitor your code and check
that your algorithms are giving the results you expect.
</p>
<p>
As always, it is also a good idea to break this task down in
to steps.  For example, you might start by writing some code
that just prints out the memory map, showing each region that
we might consider in turn and confirming that we are
at least working from the correct input.  In my testing, this
produced output that looks like the following (yours, of course,
may vary a little, and that doesn't necessarily mean that there
is anything wrong):
<pre>
  Considering [0-9fbff]
  Considering [9fc00-9ffff]
  Considering [f0000-fffff]
  Considering [100000-1fdffff]
  Considering [1fe0000-1ffffff]
  Considering [fffc0000-ffffffff]
</pre>
Because these regions of memory do not always match with page
boundaries, we may have to do a little rounding (remember Step 2).
To check I had the right approach there, I made further modifications
to my code to calculate and display appropriate page boundaries
within each page.  My output at this stage was as follows (and
again, yours may well vary, depending on the input data and the
details of how you wrote your formatting code):
<pre>
  Considering [0-9fbff], full pages [0-9efff]
  Considering [9fc00-9ffff], full pages [a0000-9ffff]
  Considering [f0000-fffff], full pages [f0000-fffff]
  Considering [100000-1fdffff], full pages [100000-1fdffff]
  Considering [1fe0000-1ffffff], full pages [1fe0000-1ffffff]
  Considering [fffc0000-ffffffff], full pages [fffc0000-ffffffff]
</pre>
We can quickly confirm that all of the addresses in the "full pages"
output here are valid page boundaries: the start addresses all end
with 12 zero bits (three hexadecimal zeros) while the end addresses
all end with 12 one bits (three hexadecimal <tt>f</tt> digits).
Continue in a similar way, following the steps described in the
<tt>TODO</tt> notes, to build your complete implementation, pausing
as necessary for testing ...</p>

<p><b>Final result:</b></p>
<p>Once this portion of your code is complete you will have set the
<tt>physStart</tt> and <tt>physEnd</tt> parameters to span a contiguous
block of pages that (a) fits within the available physical memory,
and (b) does not conflict with any region of memory in which other
code has been loaded at boot time.</p>

<p>The output that I got at this stage of the process was:
</p><pre>
   Will allocate from region [403000-1ffdfff], 29339648 bytes
</pre><p>
Yours should look similar, but don't worry if it's not exactly the
same: differences in the way we've coded our solutions, or in the
QEMU command line that we use, could cause small differences in the
output that you see here.  Note that we've found a block of 29+MB here,
which should keep us going for some time :-)</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 4: Allocation of pages</h2><p>
Now that you've identified a region of available pages, it might be
time to turn your attention to the <tt>allocPage()</tt> function that
appears near the top of <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt>.  The <tt>TODO</tt>
text should give you enough information to complete this task,
but make sure that you are using physical and virtual addresses
properly, converting between them using the <tt>toPhys()</tt>
and <tt>fromPhys()</tt> macros as necessary.  For example, if you
wanted to write an <tt>unsigned</tt> zero value in to memory at the
physical address in <tt>physStart</tt>, then you could do something
like the following: 
<pre>
    // Find the virtual address for memory at physStart:
    unsigned* page = fromPhys(unsigned*, physStart);
    // And then write a zero at that location:
    *page = 0;
    // (We need to use virtual addresses for memory accesses
    // because we are running with the MMU turned on ...)
</pre>
Note also that, if <tt>physStart</tt> holds the physical address of
an unused page of memory on entry to <tt>allocPage()</tt>, then the
next available page of memory will begin at the physical address
given by <tt>nextPage(physStart)</tt>.
</p>
<p>For testing, you could always try inserting a few calls to
<tt>allocPage()</tt> at an appropriate point in the <tt>kernel()</tt>
function and then printing out the results.  You should see output
addresses that are (1) within the selected region of memory, (2)
properly aligned to page boundaries (i.e., the least significant
twelve bits should be zero), and (3) increasing with each subsequent
call to <tt>allocPage()</tt>.  
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 5: Adding kernel space mappings to new page directories</h2><p>
Once you've completed <tt>allocPage()</tt>, you should be able to
get past the lines of code in <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt> that try to
allocate and print out the new page directory, <tt>newpdir</tt>.
But don't expect to see any entries in that new page directory just
yet; we'll need to add these ourselves.  This would be a good time
to turn your attention to the <tt>TODO</tt> item in the <tt>allocPdir()</tt>
function in <tt>kernel/paging.c</tt>.  As hinted earlier, the C code that
you'll need to write here has some strong similarities to (some
parts of) the assembly code at the start of <tt>kernel/init.S</tt> ...
</p><p>
Once this is done, you should get some output that looks something
like the following:
</p><pre>
  Page directory at c0406000
    300: [c0000000-c03fffff] =&gt; [0-3fffff], superpage
    301: [c0400000-c07fffff] =&gt; [400000-7fffff], superpage
    302: [c0800000-c0bfffff] =&gt; [800000-bfffff], superpage
    303: [c0c00000-c0ffffff] =&gt; [c00000-ffffff], superpage
    304: [c1000000-c13fffff] =&gt; [1000000-13fffff], superpage
    305: [c1400000-c17fffff] =&gt; [1400000-17fffff], superpage
    306: [c1800000-c1bfffff] =&gt; [1800000-1bfffff], superpage
    307: [c1c00000-c1ffffff] =&gt; [1c00000-1ffffff], superpage
</pre>
<p>Of course, this looks a lot like the initial page directory
shown previously, albeit without the mappings at low addresses.
Don't worry if your output looks ever so slightly different: this
might just be the result of minor differences in the way we've
written our respective implementations.  That said, <em>it is
important that this new page directory does not include any
mappings for memory at addresses below <tt>c0000000</tt></em>:
this is necessary to avoid conflicts with any future user space
mappings that we might want to make.  
</p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 6: Are you feeling lucky?</h2>
<p>Head back in to <tt>kernel/kernel.c</tt>, and
enable the code that will switch to your newly created page directory.
Unfortunately, even if you've done everything correctly so far,
you'll find that things don't work quite as we might hope :-(  But
all is not lost.  To help figure out what is causing the problem,
try inserting a call to <tt>halt()</tt> immediately after the
<tt>setPdir()</tt> call and then use QEMU's monitor to check on the
status of the CPU (<tt>"info cpus"</tt>, for example).  Then try moving
the <tt>halt</tt> after the <tt>printf()</tt> call and try again.
What does this tell us???</p>

<p>We're obviously running in to a problem here ... but what might
that be???  Clearly it's something that happens in between those two
points where you inserted calls to <tt>halt</tt>.  But the only thing
there is a straightforward <tt>printf()</tt> call, and we know that
worked just fine previously ...</p>

<p>Think carefully about the purpose of <tt>printf</tt> and how it
communicates information to the user of a computer system.  In general
terms, what memory locations would you expect it to be accessing???
And what physical addresses are those locations mapped to by the new
page directory???</p>

<p>If you're still puzzled, one way to get a little extra insight
into what is happening is to find the line in <tt>kernel/init.S</tt>
that defines <tt>handler num=14,...</tt> and then change the associated
<tt>func</tt> value from <tt>nohandler</tt> to <tt>pfhandler</tt>.
And if that still leaves you mistified, don't forget that you can
always ask us for a little extra help!  [Aside: If you do edit the
code to use <tt>pfhandler</tt>, you might want to ask yourself:
Why does the resulting output show a <tt>T</tt> character immediately
before the word <tt>Page</tt>???]</p>

<p>Once you've figured out what's going on, be sure that
you don't say it out loud: you don't want to spoil the opportunity
for the folks around you to figure this out on their own, no matter
how strongly they might claim to disagree with that statement! :-)</p>


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 7: Mapping single pages</h2>
<p>Although we've used 4MB super page mappings for the kernel space
region of our page directories, we'll restrict ourselves to using 4KB
mappings within the user space region.  In particular, this means that
we'll need to start using some page table structures in addition to
the top level page directory.</p>

<p>Head on back to <tt>kernel/paging.c</tt>, and work on the
<tt>TODO</tt> items in the <tt>mapPage()</tt> function.  You might find
it useful to look over the code in the <tt>showPdir()</tt> function
at this point for an example of "walking" over page directory and page
table structures.  (Hint: <tt>showPdir</tt> is just a few lines below
<tt>mapPage</tt>.)  The code that you need here isn't particularly
difficult, but you will need to think through the individual steps
very carefully.  For example, you'll need to start by identifying an
appropriate page directory slot, then looking for the page table in
that slot (or allocating a new one if necessary), and then find the
appropriate page table slot to fill.  Use your bit-twiddling skills
(and/or some of the macros from <tt>kernel/memory.h</tt>) to help
with this, and again remember that you can insert <tt>printf()</tt>
calls along the way to check that your code is performing correctly.
Last, but not least, remember to distinguish between physical and
virtual addresses.  For example, the addresses that are stored in
page directory entries, for example, are physical addresses, and
you will need to calculate a corresponding virtual address before
you can actually read the data they are pointing to.  Once again,
the <tt>fromPhys()</tt> and <tt>toPhys()</tt> macros will be useful
here ...</p>

<p>You might also benefit from looking at the Intel diagram that
shows the bit-level representations that are used for PDEs and PTEs;
remember that there's a snapshot of that diagram at the start of
this document.</p>

<h2>Step 8: The end, for this week</h2><p>
Once you've reached this step, you should have all the tools you
need to fix that pesky problem from Step 6 &mdash; a single call
to <tt>mapPage()</tt> should be enough!  When you see a message
indicating that <tt>"The kernel will now halt!"</tt>, you can confirm
that it is accurate (e.g., using QEMU's <tt>info cpus</tt>), and
then declare victory!</p>

<p>[Or you could start working to further configure the new
page directory so that you can run a user level program within its
own protected address space.  (And why stop at just one running
user program?)  I'm not going to try to stop you, but I should
probably tell you that this is exactly what we'll be doing in
next week's lab, so you can expect some more detailed instructions
for that soon ... ]</p>
