<p>This page describes a short series of IA32 assembly language
exercises that were inspired by techniques for generating textual
output on a basic display screen in computer systems with video
RAM buffers.  For testing purposes, we simulate the effect
of running these programs by generating images in a regular
terminal window, using ANSI escape sequences to set foreground
and background color attributes as appropriate.  Nevertheless,
code like this could also be very useful in a real, bare metal
system.
</p>

<p>These instructions assume that you are using a standard x86
Linux machine with standard tools for compiling and running C
programs.  No special hardware is required: a simple terminal
window should be sufficient for running these programs, so long as
it has (at least) 25 rows and 80 columns.</p>

<p>We suggest that you develop your solutions to these and future
exercises in a folder called <tt>~/Documents/llp</tt>, and we will
assume that you have used that path in what follows, and in other
documents.  But of course you are welcome to use a different
directory, with corresponding adjustments to these instructions,
if that suits your needs better.</p>

<p>A set of files that provide a starting point for these exercises
can be downloaded as <a href="vram.tar.gz">vram.tar.gz</a>.  We
suggest that you download this file and then unpack its contents
using the following sequence of commands (of course, you will need
to make adjustments if you are using a different folder (in Line 1)
or if your downloads are stored in a different location (Line 2)):
<pre>
  cd ~/Documents/llp
  tar xvzf ~/Downloads/vram.tar.gz.
  cd vram
</pre>
The last command here moves you in to a newly created
<tt>vram</tt> folder, which means that you are ready to begin.
(You are welcome to take a look at the files in your new
<tt>vram</tt> folder right now of course, but further details will
be presented as they are needed in the following.)</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The video systems on early PCs supported a simple text
display mode with 80 columns and 25 lines.  Programs on these
machines generated output to be displayed on the screen by
writing an appropriate sequence of values in to a special block
of memory known as <em>video RAM</em>.  As such, video RAM is
a simple example of <em>memory-mapped I/O</em>. (In this case,
of course, there is mostly just O(output) and not much I(input)!)
In fact, although the machines we typically use today have much
more powerful graphics systems, many of them still support a
very basic graphics mode using video RAM; on some machines, you
might even catch a very brief glimpse of this if you watch your
computer boot, or if you interrupt that boot process to access
and potentially change configuration settings in its BIOS.</p>

<p>In practical terms, the video RAM on these systems was
organized as a contiguous block of memory containing two bytes
for each character on the screen.  The first of those two byte
holds an eight bit "character code" using an extended version
of ASCII codes.  For example:</p>
<p align="center">
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Code</th><td>...</td><td> 32</td><td>...</td><td> 48</td><td> 49</td><td>...</td><td> 65</td><td> 66</td><td>...</td><td> 97</td><td> 98</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><th>Character</th><td>...</td><td>' '</td><td>...</td><td>'0'</td><td>'1'</td><td>...</td><td>'A'</td><td>'B'</td><td>...</td><td>'a'</td><td>'b'</td><td>...</td></tr>
</table>
<!--
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Code</th><th>Character           </th></tr>
<tr><td>...</td> <td>    ...             </td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td>  <td><tt>' '</tt> (space)</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td> <td>    ...             </td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td>  <td><tt>'0'</tt>        </td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td>  <td><tt>'1'</tt>        </td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td> <td>    ...             </td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td>  <td><tt>'A'</tt>        </td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td>  <td><tt>'B'</tt>        </td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td> <td>    ...             </td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td>  <td><tt>'a'</tt>        </td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td>  <td><tt>'b'</tt>        </td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td> <td>    ...             </td></tr>
</table>
-->
</p>
<p>
The second byte for each character specifies a video <em>attribute</em>;
this determines which foreground and background colors should be used to
display the character on screen. The attribute byte works as a bitmap:
</p>
<p align="center">
<table border=0>
  <tr><td>
  <table border=1>
    <tr>
      <td align=center width=20>Bl</td>
      <td align=center width=20>r </td>
      <td align=center width=20>g </td>
      <td align=center width=20>b </td>
      <td align=center width=20>In</td>
      <td align=center width=20>R </td>
      <td align=center width=20>G </td>
      <td align=center width=20>B </td>
    </tr>
  </table></td></tr>
  <tr><td><table border=0>
    <tr><td>where</td><td>Bl     </td><td>=</td><td>blinking text</td></tr>
    <tr><td>     </td><td>r, g, b</td><td>=</td><td>background color (red, green, blue)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>     </td><td>R, G, B</td><td>=</td><td>foreground color (red, green, blue)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>     </td><td>In     </td><td>=</td><td>foreground intensity</td></tr>
  </table></td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>The following table, for example, documents the foreground
colors that can be achieved by using different combinations of
the least four bits in each attribute byte:</p>
<p align="center">
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table border=0>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>Black</td></tr>

</p>
<p>The complete video RAM area of memory can be treated as an
array with 25 rows, each of which has 80 columns, each with
two characters.  A suitable (external) declaration for this
array in C might look something like the following:
<pre>
    extern char video[25][80][2];
</pre>
In principle, this is enough to start writing programs that
use video RAM; we can set the character code for any given
pair of row (<tt>r</tt>) and column (<tt>c</tt>) coordinates
by writing to <tt>video[r][c][0]</tt>, and the corresponding
video attribute by writing to <tt>video[r][c][0]</tt>, as in
the following example:
<pre>
    video[2][38][0] = 'h';  video[2][40][0] = 'i';  video[2][42][0] = '!';
    video[2][38][1] = 0x51; video[2][40][1] = 0x43; video[2][42][1] = 0x35;
</pre>
Nevertheless, in many practical applications, it would be
preferable if we could treat video RAM as a simple character
device that receives and displays an arbitrary sequence of
characters, scrolling as necessary to ensure that the most
recent output is always visible.</p>

<h2>A Library for Video RAM Output</h2>
<p>In the rest of this document, we will focus on the
implementation of a small library that lets programmers treat
video RAM as a conventional, character-oriented output stream.
Our specific library provides four main features: 
<dl>
<dt><tt>cls()</tt></dt>
<dd>
Purpose: Clear the screen, setting every character code to <tt>' '</tt> and
reseting all of the video attributes to some default value.  For the
purposes of our library, we'll use attribute <tt>0x2e</tt>, which gives
a bright foreground color, and a background color that is as close to
PSU Green as our limited palette will allow!
</dd>

<dt><tt>outc(c)</tt></dt>
<dd>
Purpose: Output a single character on the screen; the implementation of this
function will need to maintain a current cursor position, recording
the row and column numbers in which the next output character will
be placed.  When the caller asks to output a newline, we can move
the cursor immediately to the start of the text line.  When the
cursor reaches the end of the screen, we will need to scroll the
display on screen.  In essence, this last step requires us to overwrite
the first line on the screen with the text from the second line, then
overwrite the second line with the text from the third, and so on,
until we reach the end of the screen and overwrite the last line with
a blank (empty) line.
</dd>

<dt><tt>setAttr(a)</tt></dt>
<dd>
Purpose: Set the video attribute that will be used for all characters
that are displayed using calls to <tt>outc()</tt> (until a different
attribute is specified by a subsequent <tt>setAttr()</tt> call, of
course).
</dd>

<dt><tt>outhex(n)</tt></dt>
<dd>
Purpose: Output an eight character string with the hexadecimal
representation for the unsigned argument <tt>n</tt>.
For example, the number <tt>10</tt> would be displayed as
<tt>0000000A</tt>, while the number <tt>1024</tt> would be
displayed as <tt>00000400</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>The <tt>video.h</tt> file that is included in the <tt>vram</tt>
folder is a C header file that provides declarations for these
functions.  This file can be included in any program that makes use
of the library, such as the following example (<tt>video1.c</tt> in
the <tt>vram</tt> directory):
<pre>
    #include "video.h"
    
    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        int i, j;
        cls();
        video[2][38][0] = 'h';  video[2][40][0] = 'i';  video[2][42][0] = '!';
        video[2][38][1] = 0x51; video[2][40][1] = 0x43; video[2][42][1] = 0x35;
        display();
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
This code uses the <tt>cls()</tt> call to clear the screen and generates
a very brief greeting at specific screen coordinates using direct array
writes, as described previously.  The <tt>display()</tt> call at the end
of the program is a reference to a function defined in <tt>videodisp.c</tt>,
which uses ANSI escape code sequences to display an approximation of what
the image in video RAM might look like on a conventional terminal (assuming
that the terminal is at least 80 columns wide).  You are welcome to look
at the code in <tt>videodisp.c</tt>, of course, but doing so should not be
strictly necessary to complete these exercises.</p>

<p>The <tt>vram</tt> folder
also includes the beginnings of an assembly language implementation for
the library in the file <tt>videoasm.s</tt> ... although, as you will soon
see when you look at the files, all of the functions are implemented by
simple stubs that do not actually do anything.  We can compile and link
all of these pieces together using the following command line:
<pre>
    gcc -m32 -o video1 video1.c videodisp.c videoasm.s
</pre>
For convenience, you may also use the provided <tt>Makefile</tt>,
in which case you can generate the <tt>video1</tt> executable by
typing <tt>make video1</tt>.  Whichever option you choose, however,
should produce something like the following output (click the image,
if necessary, for a larger version):
</p>
<p align=center><a href="0.png"><img src="0.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>By looking at details like the terminal window size that is displayed
at the top of the image, we can see that the dark block shown here corresponds
to an 80x25 display with the three expected characters displayed close to the
center of the third row.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Clearing the Screen</h2>
<p>Given our earlier description of the <tt>cls()</tt> function, you
might have been expecting to see a green background in the previous
image.  The black background appears instead because the initial value
of the attribute bytes in our <tt>video</tt> buffer is zero (which
corresponds to black text on a black background) and because the
implementation of <tt>cls()</tt> is just a stub that doesn't actually
modify the contents of video RAM; that is, it doesn't do anything to
initialize the video RAM to set a green background for each character.</p>

<p>Your first task is to provide a working implementation for <tt>cls()</tt>
so that the output produced when you run <tt>video1</tt> looks something like
the following:</p>
<p align=center><a href="1.png"><img src="1.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>Given the earlier C declaration of <tt>video</tt> as a
multi-dimensional array of characters, you might be tempted to
implement this function using a pair of nested loops, with one
loop using indices from 0 to 24 to scan different rows, and
another using indices from 0 to 79 to scan different columns,
and an inner loop body that initializes each character and
attribute byte to an appropriate value.  A solution that works
that way is acceptable here, but there are simpler ways to code
this up.  In addition, from a performance perspective, you might
consider methods that allow you to write more than one byte value
at a time, reducing the total number of writes that are needed to
complete the task.  Again, however, handling this detail is not a
strict requirement for completing this exercise!</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Scrolling</h2>
<p>As a first step to implementing the <tt>outc()</tt> function,
your next task will be to write some code that will scroll the
screen up by one line.  For now, you can put this code in the
stub for <tt>outc()</tt> in <tt>videoasm.s</tt> so that you can
test your implementation by using a short sequence of <tt>outc()</tt>
calls.  For example, you might use the following program (included
as <tt>video2.c</tt> in the <tt>vram</tt> folder) as a test case:
<pre>
    #include "video.h"
  
    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        int i, j;
        cls();
        video[2][38][0] = 'h';  video[2][40][0] = 'i';  video[2][42][0] = '!';
        video[2][38][1] = 0x51; video[2][40][1] = 0x43; video[2][42][1] = 0x35;
  
        setAttr(7);
        outc('h');
        outc('i');
  
        display();
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
If your <tt>outc()</tt> implementation handles scrolling correctly
but otherwise ignores the argument provided, then the output that you
get when you run <tt>video2</tt> should look something like this:</p>
<p align=center><a href="2.png"><img src="2.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>Note, in particular, that the three character greeting that was
originally displayed on the third line has now been shuffled up to
the top line as a result of the two calls to <tt>outc()</tt>.  Yay
for scrolling!</p>

<h2>Exercise 3: Character Output</h2>
<p>Once you have scrolling working, you'll want to complete the
implementation of <tt>outc()</tt> by adding support for character
output.  This will require you to use and modify the values that
are stored in the <tt>row</tt> and <tt>col</tt> variables that
are declared at the start of <tt>videoasm.s</tt> and used to track
the "current cursor position", as well as the "current attribute"
setting from the <tt>attr</tt> variable.  You'll also need to access
the argument to <tt>outc()</tt> that specifies which character should
be output (it will be on the stack, and can be read using indexed
addressing with a suitable offset from <tt>%ebp</tt>).  Note that
you should make a special case when the newline character is
passed as input to <tt>outc()</tt>, moving the cursor immediately
to the next line instead of advancing to the next column.  Finally,
make sure that you don't advance either the <tt>row</tt> or
<tt>col</tt> variables beyond their allowed limits of 25 and 80,
respectively.  If the column number passes 79, you can just move
to the next row, of course.  If you reach the last row of the
display, however, then you'll want to scroll the display instead
of further incrementing the <tt>row</tt> number.  The logic that
you need here is not really as complicated as the preceding
description might make it sound, but don't be shy about sketching
it out as a small flowchart if that helps you to get a clearer
picture of what is required!</p>

<p>When you've finished this, you should get something like the
following as output when you run <tt>video2</tt>:</p>
<p align=center><a href="3.png"><img src="3.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>This output isn't quite as satisfying as might be hoped: the
two <tt>outc()</tt> calls are responsible for the two black 
boxes seen at the top left of the output display.  But we can't
actually see the characters here because the default video
attribute is black text on a black background!  We'll fix that
in the next step ...</p>

<h2>Exercise 4: Setting the Current Attribute</h2>
<p>Your next task is to fill in an implementation for the
<tt>setAttr()</tt> function; you should find that this is
a very simple task&mdash;as long as you've properly understood
how arguments are passed in to functions&mdash;so don't be
alarmed if you manage to implement this with just a couple of
lines of code!  Once you've handled this, the <tt>setAttr(7)</tt>
call in the code for <tt>video2</tt> will work some minor
magic in specifying white text on a black background&mdash;much
easier to read!&mdash;and you should be rewarded with an
output that looks something like the following:</p>
<p align=center><a href="4.png"><img src="4.png" width=540></a></p>

<h2>Exercise 5: Hexadecimal Output</h2>
<p>For our final exercise, we'll turn to the implementation of the
<tt>outhex()</tt> function.  Conceptually, this is a fairly simple
function: we're not going to worry about sign bits or leading zeros&mdash;
every number will be output with exactly 8 digits&mdash;and we're
not going to try converting to decimal, or doing anything else that
might require using a buffer of some kind.  Nevertheless, this will
still be a good exercise to test your comfort level with classic
"bit twiddling" operations like bitwise rotate, and, etc...</p>

<p>For testing purposes, you can use the following program (which,
once again, is already provided for you, this time in <tt>video3.c</tt>):
<pre>
    #include "video.h"
    
    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        int i, j;
        cls();
        unsigned val = 1;
        for (i=0; i<26; i++) {
            setAttr((i&amp;7)&lt;&lt;4);
            for (j=0; j&lt;i; j++) {
                outc(' ');
            }
            outc(65+i);
            outc(97+i);
            outc(' ');
            outhex(val);
            val += val;
            outc('\n');
        }
        display();
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
If you've completed all of the previous steps, but have yet to modify
the stub for <tt>outhex()</tt>, then you should see output like the
following when you run this program:</p>
<p align=center><a href="5.png"><img src="5.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>[This example also provides some further opportunities for testing
your ealier implementation of scrolling and <tt>outc()</tt>; note how
the lines for <tt>Aa</tt> and <tt>Bb</tt> are missing in the display
above, having been scrolled off the top of the display by the remaining
24 letters of the alphabet and the one extra blank line at the end.]</p>
<p>Once your implementation of <tt>outhex()</tt> is complete, you should
see output that looks something like the following instead:</p>
<p align=center><a href="6.png"><img src="6.png" width=540></a></p>
<p>Notice that the numbers seen here correspond to powers of two in
hexadecimal notation: this reflects the fact that the program outputs
the value in the variable <tt>val</tt> at each step, having initialized
it to 1 at the start of the program, and then doubling it with
each subsequent loop iteration.</p>

<p>It's reasonable to assume (I hope!) that your implementation
of <tt>outhex()</tt> will take the form of a loop whose body is
executed eight times, with each iteration involving a separate
call to <tt>outc()</tt>.  As a result, you might start to run in to
problems here if you haven't taken the steps that are expected and,
in general, needed to save and restore specific registers in
<tt>outc()</tt>.  In particular, following the System V ABI conventions,
if your implementation of <tt>outc()</tt>&mdash;or any one of the other
functions for that matter&mdash;uses the registers
<tt>%ebx</tt>, <tt>%esi</tt>, or <tt>%edi</tt>, then you must take
appropriate steps to make sure those registers contain the same
value at the end of the function as they did on entry.  This is
typically accomplished by inserting an appropriate <tt>pushl</tt>
instruction at the start of the function and a matching <tt>popl</tt>
at the end.  Similarly, if your code for <tt>outhex()</tt> is using
any of the <tt>%eax</tt>, <tt>%ecx</tt>, or <tt>%edx</tt> registers
at the point where it calls <tt>outc()</tt>, then you should take
appropriate steps to ensure that the values in those registers cannot
be "clobbered" (i.e., overwritten) while the <tt>outc()</tt> code
is running.</p>

<h2>Other Ideas</h2>
<p>Congratulations, you've reached the end of this set of exercises!
But if you've enjoyed working on this, then there are still plenty
of opportunities to continue by adding new functions or features to
the library.  For example, you could add:
<ul>
<li>A function for setting the cursor position to specific coordinates
    (be sure to check that the coordinate values are in range!)
<li>A function for outputing numbers in decimal notation.
<li>A mechanism that allows you to specify a "window" within the 80x25
    text display where new output will be displayed and scrolled, without
    changing the text that appears in other parts of the display.
<li>A function for drawing a rectangular block of characters on the
    screen with a given height, width, and starting coordinates.
<li>...
<li>Come to think of it, we could even try running a program like this
    in a bare metal environment with real video RAM!  In theory, that
    would allow us not only to see
    the final state, but also to watch intermediate steps along
    the way.  (Just don't expect to see much of that intermediate work
    in detail as it flashes by unless you've taken some steps to slow
    the code down in significant ways, such as by inserting explicit
    delays, for example.)
</ul>
