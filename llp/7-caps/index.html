<p>
The exercises described on this page build on the ideas that you have
developed in the earlier labs on context switching and paging, but
also incorporate new ideas that were introduced in the Week 7 lecture
about capabilities.  You should make sure that you have completed
the earlier labs, and reviewed the slides from the lecture before
proceeding.  Although the implementation of capabilities presented
here is not as sophisticated or complete, it is important to note
that the overall approach is very much informed and inspired by the
capability system in the seL4 microkernel; many more details about
that system can be found at <a href="https://sel4.systems"><tt>https://sel4.systems</tt></a>.
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Step 1: Getting set up</h2>
<p>To begin, you will need to download, unpack, and build
the source code for the simple kernel and user-level demo with
capability-based system calls that was the main focus of the capabilities
lecture.  This code is packaged as <a href="caps.tar.gz">caps.tar.gz</a>
and should be installed in
the same way as previous files: place a copy in your <tt>llp</tt>
directory; unpack using <tt>tar xvzf caps.tar.gz</tt>; and then run
<tt>make</tt> in the new <tt>caps</tt> folder.</p>

<p>In fact, as you've likely guessed based on past exercises, you can
use <tt>make run</tt> from within the <tt>caps</tt> folder to build and
run the demo program in a single step.  If you've installed everything
correctly, you should see a window that looks something
like this:</p>

<p align=center><a href="capssc.png"><img alt="image of initial screen for the capabilities lab; click on image to view full size" src="capssc.png" width=540></a></p>

<p>Note that there is a "spinner" in the top right hand corner that
is updated by the timer interrupt handler.  This is a simplified
version of the clock exercise that was suggested as a stretch
goal in the context switching lab.  Its primary purpose here is
to provide an indication that the kernel is still running, even
when no output appears on screen.  But those who did not get a
working clock for the switching demo may find some useful hints
about how to accomplish that by studying the implementation of
this simple spinner.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 2: A guided tour of the <tt>caps</tt> folder</h2>
<p>This lab draws on the techniques and ideas that have been
introduced in the previous switching and paging labs.  But with
all the extensions and modifications that we've made in the
course of those exercises, you're probably finding that the code
base is getting a little tangled and hard to navigate.  So we're
going to take advantage of this new lab to do a little clean up
work, reorganizing the code and breaking it in to smaller pieces
with a more clearly defined purpose or focus.  In this section,
we'll provide a brief tour of the important files.</p>

<p>For starters, I recommend that you run <tt>make clean</tt>
in the <tt>caps</tt> directory before you proceed; this will clear away
compiler-generated files so that we can focus on the source code.
Of course, you can always regenerate the other files later by
repeating the <tt>make</tt> or <tt>make run</tt> commands.</p>

<p>Now we'll begin our tour for real in the <tt>kernel</tt>
folder; I encourage you to follow along by reviewing each of the
listed files in an editor (or using a tool like <tt>less</tt>,
or similar), as you see fit: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>We'll start with the easiest ones: <tt>Makefile</tt>,
  <tt>kernel.ld</tt>, <tt>memory.h</tt>, <tt>context.h</tt>, and
  <tt>hardware.h</tt> are all pretty much the same as the versions of
  these files that you've seen before.  There are a few extra lines in
  the <tt>Makefile</tt> to handle the new <tt>.c</tt> files described
  below, but otherwise there's not a lot of new material to see
  here.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>init.S</tt> is a (mostly unchanged) version of the startup
  code, written in assembly, from the previous labs.  One small change
  that might be worth pointing out here, however, is a new macro
  called <tt>syscall</tt> that simplifies the task of adding a new
  system call handler.  Specifically, you want to add a new system
  call for a function called <tt>xxxx</tt>, then you should add a
  couple of lines of the following form after the definition of the
  <tt>syscall</tt> macro (where <tt>Xxxx</tt> is the name obtained
  from <tt>xxxx</tt> by capitalizing the first letter):
<pre>
  handleXxxx:
          syscall xxxx_imp
</pre>
   and also add an entry for the new system call in the IDT initialization
   code that looks something like this:
<pre>
  idtcalc handler=handleXxxx, slot=N, dpl=3
</pre>
  where <tt>N</tt> is the IDT slot/interrupt number that you'll be using
  for the new system call.  Finally, of course, you'll need to add an
  implementation of the new system call; the <tt>syscalls.c</tt> file
  described below is likely a good place to put that code.</p></li>
  
<li><p><tt>util.h</tt> just provides definitions for functions that
  can be used to <tt>halt()</tt> the CPU (assuming you're in kernel
  mode); report a <tt>fatal()</tt> error; or test for a specific
  condition using <tt>assert()</tt>.  You'll see some uses of
  <tt>assert()</tt>, in particular, at the start of the
  <tt>initMemory()</tt> function in <tt>alloc.c</tt> where it is
  used to perform some basic sanity checks and report an error
  to the kernel developer if something does not look right.  Feel
  free to use this in your own code as seems useful!</p></li>

<li><p><tt>alloc.h</tt> and <tt>alloc.c</tt> implement the algorithms
  for calculating the initial list of untyped memory capabilities that
  cover all of the unused memory based on the memory map and header
  information that are passed on at boot time.  Once created and sorted
  with the largest untyped region(s) first, the kernel allocates
  individual 4K pages from the regions at the end of the list and
  provides functions for donating entries in the list by moving them to
  an appropriate capability space slot.  You will not be expected to
  understand or modify the code in these files, but you are welcome to
  take a peek and try to figure out how they work.  From an algorithmic
  perspective, this is probably the most interesting part of the whole
  kernel implementation!</p></li>

<li><p><tt>caps.h</tt> and <tt>caps.c</tt> provide definitions and
  implementations for the different capability types that we are working
  with here.  This includes: a unique integer code for each different
  type of capability; a structure describing the layout for that
  capability type; and associated test and set functions (all of this is
  in <tt>caps.h</tt>).  The code in <tt>caps.c</tt> mostly provides
  functionality for printing out descriptions of individual capabilities
  or complete capability spaces (for debugging purposes), but also
  provides the main <tt>alloc()</tt> function for allocating a flex page
  from an untyped memory object.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>paging.h</tt> and <tt>paging.c</tt> provide definitions and
  implementations of functions for working with page directory and page
  table structures.  You've seen most of this code before, but there is
  a completed version of <tt>mapPage()</tt> from the end of the first
  paging lab that you can compare with your own implementation.  If you
  didn't quite get around to writing your own <tt>mapPage()</tt> just
  yet, fear not: you'll still have an opportunity to demonstrate your
  understanding of how these kinds of operations are written when it
  comes to implementing the <tt>mapPage</tt> and <tt>mapPageTable</tt>
  system calls later in this set of lab exercises.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>proc.h</tt> and <tt>proc.c</tt> are short files that provide
  the implementation for the data structure that we use to represent
  individual processes (<tt>struct Proc</tt>) as well as a
  <tt>reschedule()</tt> function for switching from one process to
  another.  There isn't a lot of code here that you haven't seen before,
  but you might find it useful to look at these files if you need to
  make changes to the way that processes are created or organized.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>kernel.c</tt> contains the code for initializing the kernel
  and the initial user-level processes.  You might want to modify this
  code if you are trying to test specific kernel functions that, for
  example, are used to configure a capability space.</p>

  <p>[<b>Quick quiz</b>: (not related to capabilities!) The <tt>upperRight</tt> and <tt>lowerRight</tt>
  variables that are defined in this file as global variables are only
  actually referenced within the <tt>kernel()</tt> function in this file.
  Why then would it be a mistake to declare them as local variables of the
  <tt>kernel()</tt> function?]</p>
</li>

<li><p><tt>syscalls.c</tt> collects all of the system call implementations
  in a single file so that we can compare them side by
  side.  You might notice that there are some <tt>TODO</tt> items here,
  so perhaps you'll be coming back to look at this file in more detail
  quite soon ...</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Phew, quite a lot to take in there!  Fortunately, the changes to
our <tt>user</tt> folder are a little easier to follow (it helps
that we didn't have much code there to begin with):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>Makefile</tt> and <tt>user.ld</tt> are unchanged.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>syscalls.h</tt> is a simple header file that contains
  C function prototypes for the system calls that we want to be
  able to use in our user-level program.  In other words, the
  definitions in this file describe how individual system calls
  are made available to user-level programs as if they were just
  regular function calls.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>userlib.s</tt> contains the assembly language
  initialization code for the kernel, as well as stubs for each
  of the system calls that are declared in <tt>syscalls.h</tt>.
  There are plenty of examples for you to work from here if you
  are trying to add a new system call.  Just make sure that you
  are loading the system call parameters into the appropriate
  registers, and that you are using the right IDT slot/interrupt
  number for the <tt>int</tt> instruction; these must match the
  slot numbers you've used in <tt>kernel/init.S</tt>, or else
  bad things might happen ...</p></li>

<li><p><tt>user.c</tt> contains the C code for a simple user-level
  program.  This is the place to add uses of system calls that
  you're testing.  For the time being, it's important that we
  don't allow this user-level program to terminate because the
  kernel doesn't know how to handle that.  The kernel also doesn't
  know how to respond to page faults just yet, so let's hope that
  our user-level programs are well-behaved.  Of course, we might
  also want to address these problems in other ways to make a
  more robust system ...
  </p></li>

</ul>
<p>Finally, you might have noticed that the <tt>kernel</tt> and
<tt>user</tt> folders inside the <tt>caps</tt> directory are now
joined by a third folder called <tt>capio</tt>.  This contains
source code for a simple, user-level library for performing
I/O via window capabilities.  It is similar in purpose to the
<tt>userio</tt> library that you have used previously, except that
it allows for providing a specific window capability reference
as part of each call.  (A brief description of this library is
included in the capabilities lectures.)</p>

<p>That's a lot of information to digest.  But remember that
you can always come back to check these details again later as
you need them.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 3: Fixing those TODOs</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, there are a few <tt>TODO</tt>
items in <tt>kernel/syscalls.c</tt>.  Now is the time to start
filling them in!  Essentially, what you are being asked to do
here is to complete the implementations of some system calls.
The supplied code already includes the code for system calls
whose implementation was shown in the lecture, so you can use
those as starting points/inspiration for the missing system
calls.  Each of the <tt>TODO</tt> items includes comments to
describe what that particular system call is expected to do,
so we will not waste space repeating that information here.
All of the code that is needed to support these system calls
in <tt>kernel/init.S</tt>, <tt>user/syscalls.h</tt>, and
<tt>user/userlib.s</tt> has already been provided so that
you can focus your attention on <tt>kernel/syscalls.c</tt>.
But of course you're welcome to look at the other files if you
want to check any details there or to make sure you understand
all of the steps that are needed to get from user-level code
to the implementation of a system call.</p>

<p>We'll start with the following <tt>TODO</tt> items.
I recommend that you work through them in the order they are
listed, testing at each stage:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><tt>cls_imp()</tt> and <tt>setAttr_imp()</tt> are used to
  perform operations on a <tt>WindowCap</tt>, assuming that
  the caller has the necessary permissions ...</p></li>

<li><p><tt>capclear_imp()</tt> is used to clear entries in a
  capability space.  Beware that, if a user removes the last
  capability to a given resource, then there might not be any
  way to get it back!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are some other <tt>TODO</tt> items not included in
the list above; we'll come back to finish these off later on
in Step 5.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 4: Adding a new type of capability</h2>
<p>Add a new capability type, <tt>TimerCap</tt>, and an associated
system call, <tt>getTicks(tcap)</tt>, that a user-level process
can invoke to access the current timer value via a reference,
<tt>tcap</tt>, to a <tt>TimerCap</tt>.  In the distributed code, the
timer is stored in the <tt>ticks</tt> variable inside the code for
the timer interrupt handler; you'll need to make this a global
variable so that your system call implementation can access it.</p>

<p>Some operating systems block access to accurate timer information
from user-level processes to prevent <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>.
One way to address this is to limit the resolution of the timing
information.  Extend your implementation of <tt>TimerCap</tt> to
include a number of bits that will be zero in every timer reading
that is returned through that capability.  For example, if the number
of bits is set to 3, then actual timer values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 7 will all be reported back to the holder as 0.  The holder will
still be able to see that the timer is advancing, but will not have
access to the highest available resolution.</p>

<p>Note: Remember that this is just an exercise in using capabilities:
I'm not really proposing it as a serious practical solution to avoid
timing attacks, nor am I claiming that timing attacks are a concern for
us in this lab, especially because the tick count in this implementation
does not provide a particularly high resolution to begin with!</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 5: Fixing some more TODOS</h2>
<p>Now it is time to finish off the <tt>TODO</tt> items in
<tt>kernel/syscalls.c</tt>.  The remaining items on the list
all have to do with the data structures for memory management
that we first encountered in the paging lab:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><tt>allocPage_imp()</tt> and <tt>allocPageTable_imp()</tt>
  are used to allocate objects from an untyped memory object.
  These operations follow a very similar pattern to the code that
  was illustrated in the lecture for
  allocating cspaces and untyped memory objects; we might want
  to integrate these into a single function later on to avoid
  a profusion of system calls.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>mapPage_imp()</tt> and <tt>mapPageTable_imp()</tt>
  allow a process to extend its own address space by adding
  new mappings using previously allocated page table and page
  objects.  The implementation of these functions will take a
  little bit of work, but I suggest that you take advantage of
  the code for <tt>mapPage()</tt> in <tt>paging.c</tt> (or your
  own previous implementation) to help you with this:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>The code for <tt>mapPage_imp()</tt>, once you've
      verified that the arguments are valid, will look pretty
      similar to the code for <tt>mapPage()</tt>.  One key
      difference, however, is that if we get to the point
      where <tt>mapPage()</tt> would have used <tt>allocPage()</tt>,
      then it will instead return to the user code with an error:
      this is an indication that the user code needs to install a
      suitable page table before the <tt>mapPage_imp()</tt> call
      can complete.<p></li>

  <li><p>The code for <tt>mapPageTable_imp()</tt>, again once
      the parameters have been checked, will also do much the
      same as (the first part of) <tt>mapPage()</tt>.  However,
      if it gets to the point where the code discovers that a
      page table has already been allocated, then it will return
      with an error.  Alternatively, if it reaches the point
      where <tt>mapPage()</tt> would have allocated a page table,
      then it will instead use the pointer from the page table
      capability that is passed as an argument.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In each of these cases, you can see how the kernel avoids
  performing any memory allocation, either by using a block of
  memory that the user-level code has already allocated, or else
  by terminating the system call with an error code.</p>
  </li>

</ul>
<p>The supplied user code already includes some simple uses
of these system calls that you can use for testing (based on
the example that was presented in the lecture), but of course
you are free to make up your own examples for more extensive
testing and to demonstrate your understanding of the relevant
course objectives.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 6: Adding a new system call to an existing capability type</h2>
<p>Add a new system call, invoked as <tt>remaining(ucap)</tt> from
user-level code, that can be used to determine how much unallocated
memory is left in the untyped capability specified by <tt>ucap</tt>.
That description makes it sound very simple, but it might take a
little bit more work to get this up and running!</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 7: Improving an existing operation</h2>
<p>Using the <tt>WindowCap</tt> capability type, we can print a string
of characters on an output window using a sequence of system calls, one
for each character.  While this is enough to get the job done, it is not
very efficient or practical to use so many system calls for such a
simple task!  Wouldn't it be better if we could use a single system call
to pass and display a whole string of characters at once?</p>

<p>To implement this we need a region of memory that both the user-level
program and the kernel can use to communicate with one another.  From
the kernel's perspective, we can handle this by adding a new field,
<tt>unsigned* buffer</tt>, to each <tt>struct Proc</tt> object that is
initialized to <tt>null</tt>.  For the user-level side, we can provide
a system call <tt>allocBuffer(ucap, addr)</tt> that can be invoked to
allocate a page of memory (from the untyped memory specified by
<tt>ucap</tt>) that is mapped into the address space of the user-level
process at the specified address, <tt>addr</tt>.  Of course, this
operation will fail if there is a problem with the capability (wrong
type, not enough space, etc.) or the address (in <tt>KERNEL_SPACE</tt>,
already mapped, etc.), or if a <tt>buffer</tt> has already been allocated
for this process.  But if it succeeds, then a pointer to the newly
allocated page will be saved in the <tt>buffer</tt> for the process.</p>

<p>The next step is to add a new system call, <tt>printBuffer(wcap)</tt>
that will print the string in the process buffer in the window specified
by the given <tt>WindowCap</tt>, <tt>wcap</tt>.  A user-level process
will typically invoke this system call after it has filled the buffer,
via the address that it specified in the <tt>allocBuffer()</tt> call.
On the kernel side, we have to check not only that <tt>wcap</tt> is
valid (and, presumably that it includes the permission to printing a
single character), but also that the invoking process has previously
allocated a <tt>buffer</tt>.  We'll assume that the user-level process
marks the end of the string that it wants to be displayed by adding a
null byte after all the characters, thereby following the time-honored
(and highly error-prone) tradition of C.  This creates another
obligation for the kernel, because if the user-level program "forgets"
to add that null byte, whether by mistake or design, then an over-eager
implementation of <tt>printBuffer()</tt> might be tricked into reading
past the end of the buffer page, and trigger a kernel page fault.  That
would be pretty embarrassing, so make sure your implementation stops
before it goes past the end of the page!  If you like, you could even
add another field to the <tt>WindowCap</tt> capability to set a "maximum
message length" value as an extra badge.  Of course, the kernel should
also be ready to ignore that value if it is more than the length of the
buffer page ...</p>

<p>[The technique described here still has some potential performance
problems because it forces the user-level process to copy data into
the buffer area before making the call to <tt>printBuffer()</tt>.
You could imagine an alternative approach that provides user-level
processes with a system call <tt>printString(wcap, addr)</tt> where
<tt>addr</tt> can be an arbitrary address that points to a string in
the caller's address space.  The kernel, of course, will be able to
read the characters stored at that address.  But again, our poor
kernel will have to careful and protect itself against misbehaving
user-level programs that supply an invalid <tt>addr</tt> that would
cause the kernel to page fault if it tried to access that memory.
Happily, the kernel also has access to the page directory and page
table for the process, so it can check that the address is valid
before attempting the operation.  But this will take a fair bit
of extra work ...]</p>

<p>Note that the <tt>buffer</tt> technique described above is inspired,
in large part, by the approach that is used in seL4 to allocate an `IPC
buffer' to threads that need to send or receive messages that are
more than a few words in length, and hence cannot be stored completely
in CPU registers.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 8: Let's retype that ... (a stretch goal)</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the various functions for allocating
objects from an untyped memory area (e.g., <tt>allocCspace</tt>,
<tt>allocUntyped()</tt>, <tt>allocPage()</tt>, etc.) all have a
pretty similar structure.  In addition, there are often situations
where we need to make multiple allocator calls in a row to allocate
a sequence of objects.  One way to tackle these problems is to
collapse all of the allocators into a single system call of the
form:</p>
<pre>
  retype(ucap, type, bits, slot, num)
</pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p><tt>ucap</tt> is a capability to untyped memory.</p></li>

<li> <p><tt>type</tt> is an integer code that represents the type of the
     objects and associated capabilities that we want to allocate.
     For example, we could use 1 for a <tt>CspaceCap</tt>,
     2 for an <tt>UntypedCap</tt>, etc..  The numbers are arbitrary
     so long as distinct capability types use distinct numbers and
     both kernel and user-level code use the same mapping from
     numbers to capability types.</p></li>

<li> <p><tt>bits</tt> is an extra field that can be used to specify the
     size of the objects to be allocated; this field is needed when
     we are allocating new <tt>UntypedCap</tt>s, but can be ignored
     for all other capability types in our current implementation.</p></li>

<li> <p><tt>slot</tt> is a reference to an empty slot in a capability space
     where the capability to the first new object will be placed.</p></li>

<li> <p><tt>num</tt> is the total number of objects that we want to be
     allocated by this system call.  For the call to be valid, we
     must ensure that the untyped memory has enough free space for
     the requested number of objects, and we must also ensure that
     there are enough empty capability slots&mdash;starting at
     <tt>slot</tt> and continuing with <tt>slot+1</tt>,
     <tt>slot+2</tt>, and so on, as necessary&mdash;to hold all of
     the new capabilities.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Your task now, of course, is to implement this all-powerful allocator
system call.  It will take a fair bit of work, but then you will also
be able to throw away all those close-to-duplicated <tt>allocXXX()</tt>
functions, and it will also be much easier after this to add support for
allocating new types of object.  In addition, you won't need to rewrite
all your existing user level code to use the new <tt>retype()</tt> call:
instead, you can just write simple wrappers in <tt>user/syscalls.h</tt>
that implement each of the original, more specialized allocators as
special cases of <tt>retype()</tt>.</p>

<p>Once again, we should also acknowledge that the <tt>retype()</tt>
system call is inspired by a system call of the same name in the
seL4 microkernel.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h2>Step 9: What's next?</h2>
<p>Really?  That was quite a lot of work, and you still want more?
Of course, I'm glad to hear that, but I'd still suggest this might
be a good time to take a break.  In your idle moments, however,
you might still want to be considering questions like the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to create new processes
  on the fly?  We could use untyped memory to allocate space for the
  underlying process structures, but the <tt>proc</tt> array that we've
  been relying on so far has a fixed size.  Maybe it's time to rethink
  that and allow an arbitrary collection of <tt>struct Proc</tt>
  objects to be linked together in a circular, doubly-linked list so
  that it is easy to add and remove individual elements?  This would
  add <tt>struct Proc* prev;</tt> and <tt>struct Proc* next</tt>
  pointers to every process, but then we could implement round
  robin scheduling just by switching from <tt>current</tt> to
  <tt>current-&gt;next</tt>.</p></li>

<li><p>Now, before we worry about creating new processes, we could
  provide a new system call that allows existing processes to terminate
  themselves, removing them from the list of current processes.  This
  could be handled gracefully by providing a suitable system call.
  But it is probably also time for us to replace the old <tt>nohandler</tt>
  with some code that will terminate a process if it triggers an exception.
  We don't really want a user-level process to bring down the whole system
  just because it tries to divide by zero, or causes a page fault.

<li><p>This raises another issue: we could find ourselves with no
  runnable processes; that is, with nothing for <tt>current</tt> to
  point to!  For now, we might just decide that its time for the kernel
  to terminate too.  But, if we add even more features to our kernel,
  then it might just be that we need to wait for some new event&mdash;a
  keyboard or timer interrupt, for example&mdash;that will restart a
  previously suspended task or process.  With that in mind, perhaps
  we'll want to have a special `idle process' that can be used when no
  other <tt>current</tt> process is ready to run ...  </p></li>

<li><p>Finally, we're ready to think about what it might take to
  allow the creation of a new process ...

to see how a substantially more complete capability abstraction fits
in to a real-world microkernel implementation (that has also been the
subject of a successful formal verification effort)!</p>
